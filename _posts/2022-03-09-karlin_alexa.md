This image depicts Los Angeles City Hall in front of the Hoover Dam. It was created in the 1930s and demonstrates the importance of water in LA and across Southern California during the time. Since the Europeans arrived in Southern California hundreds of years ago, water has dictated where people settled, government, and politics. The European settlers created their original pueblos neighboring the Los Angeles River in order to use its water. As the population of LA exponentially increased, a greater demand was placed on the river and it was not able to supply. City leaders began looking elsewhere to import water to sustain the city’s growth. By the late 19th century, LA was in a desperate sprawl for water (Gumprecht). 

The irregular nature of rainfall in LA is a main component of the drought problems. With an average rainfall of 15 inches a year, the city can experience anywhere from a few inches, causing intense drought, to upwards of 10 inches, leading to catastrophic flooding (Total Seasonal Rainfall). LA leaders were unable to reduce water usage among the citizens. They made little attempt to catch rainwater during the years of high rainfall. They believed the only viable solution would be importing water from other locations to Southern California. 

LA leaders began looking elsewhere to provide water for its citizens. The construction of the LA Aqueduct began in the late 20th century and carried water from the Owen’s Lake to Southern California (Water and Power). After years of increased water usage and population growth, the lake dried up and LA was forced once again to look for water. This time, they would look to the Colorado River. The Hoover Dam, depicted in the picture above, remains a key component of the aqueduct. The dam not only provides electricity for much of the Los Angeles area, but also diverts water that is sent to various locations. It lies on the border of Arizona and Nevada and stands at over 700 feet tall (Hoover Dam). 

Water is a vital aspect of creating the Southern California feel. From fountains to lush greenery, LA has been portrayed as a tropical paradise. Water was and remains a driving factor in population growth across Southern California. The picture represents the importance that water plays for the city as a whole.
