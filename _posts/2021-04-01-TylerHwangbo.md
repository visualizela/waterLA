The St. Francis Dam, constructed from 1924 to 1926, was under the supervision of LA Department of Water and Power Chief Engineer William Mulholland and is well-known because of its collapse which killed around 450 civilians. My primary source document shows only the center section of the dam (also known as the tombstone) standing, and the rest of the dam is not pictured because it got swept away by the billion gallons of water the dam was holding back.

In 1920, the population of the city of Los Angeles was around 576,673 people (almost double the population in 1910), and so the budding metropolis needed to find a way to supply water to the growing population (US Census Bureau, 1920). The Owens River Aqueduct had been completed a decade earlier and Mulholland wanted to create reservoirs to store aqueduct water so that it could feed the city during dry seasons and in the event of a failure of the aqueduct (Jackson, D., & Hundley, N., 2004). The site of the St. Francis Dam was originally chosen to be in the Big Tujunga Canyon, but because local ranchers inflated the price of their land, Mulholland ultimately decided to abandon Big Tujunga Canyon and instead build the dam in the San Francisquito Canyon (Rogers, 2007).

On two separate occasions, the Bureau of Water Works and Design (now known as LADWP) decided to raise the height of the dam, and the dam ended up being 20 feet taller than originally planned and it could now hold back 38,168 acre feet of water (Rogers, 1995). The St. Francis Dam was a gravity dam, so it held back the water with its weight. Increasing the height of the dam while neglecting the width of the base was cause for concern. This was not the sole reason why the dam collapsed. After the St. Francis Dam collapse, many researchers like Carl and E. L. Grunsky, both civil engineers, as well as Bailey Willis, a geologist, noted hydrostatic uplift as another reason why the dam failed (Rogers, 2007). Hydrostatic uplift is where water seeps into the base of the dam and pushes it up, weakening the dam. Other reasons include the fact that the dam was built on an old landslide as well as the tension cracks formed in the dam due to the heat that was formed when mixing the portland cement. It is interesting to note that the Hoover Dam’s design plans were completed the same year the St. Francis Dam was being built yet the Hoover Dam incorporated many safety designs that the St. Francis Dam lacked (ie. grout curtain to prevent uplift) (McMullen, 2004).

The collapse of the St. Francis Dam had many long-lasting impacts. First, and most importantly, more than 450 people died as a result of the collapse. Hundreds drowned in the middle of the night without warning. Also, Mulholland’s career was ruined and homes and cities were destroyed, but a positive impact was that there was increased oversight in future water projects as a new state law required dams to be “under the jurisdiction of state authorities” (Standiford, 2016, pp.112).
