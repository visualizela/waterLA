As surprising as it may be, flooding was a big part of Los Angeles’s water history. Los Angeles geography and rainfall patterns paired with its exponential urbanization in the 20th century made the LA county a perfect mix for intense flooding that was able to destroy seemingly robust infrastructure, as shown in the picture above. Despite many tries of the county to build flood-proof infrastructure, there was a continuous pattern in the 19th to 20th century of intense flooding, destruction, and rebuilding with not enough protection from the next flood.

Intense flooding has always been a defining characteristic of Los Angeles’s climate. In fact, in the early Spanish Portola expedition to Los Angeles in 1769, Crespi noted that there was early clear evidence of flooding in the rainy season. Atmospheric rivers, or pathways of moisture in the atmosphere, coming from the Pacific Ocean cool and condense over the steep San Gabriel mountains that border Los Angeles county in the east. Once the water falls down as precipitation over the mountains, runoff gains speed from gravitational energy allowing it to bring sediments and bigger rocks from the mountains to the valley below. This mixture of water and sediments makes the flood water extra capable of destroying infrastructure and altering the course of the LA River.

As the Los Angeles population was growing exponentially in the 19th century, urban developments spread closer to the mountains putting them at greater danger for flood damage. The concrete and impervious ground cover used in developments in Los Angeles allowed flood water to travel further as they could not soak back into the ground  easily.

Damages for floods in the 1800s were notable, but not nearly as destructive as those in the early to mid 1900s where there was more infrastructure but not a proportional amount of flood protection. The county of Los Angeles was aware of this discrepancy and started haphazard attempts at flood protection (such as levees, check dams, and debris basins) with the limited funding they received from small bond measures and municipal taxes. However, the continuous increase in urban development offset these early flood control measures. It was not until the 1930s when massive floods struck and the LA county received federal support, funding, and assistance from Flood Control Acts and the Army Corps of Engineers to remedy flooding problems. 

These flood control efforts, along with the increasing amount of funding to infrastructure in LA as it became an important location for American troops in World War II, began to fix the cycle of flood destruction in LA. The picture of a fallen bridge from the flood from May 4th, 1941 was at the time when flood protection was improving, but still not perfect. This picture demonstrates the strength of the floods as the water and sediment slurry was able to undermine the concrete base of the Santa Fe Railroad bridge and cause the whole thing to collapse. Flood control has advanced over time, but as urban developments continue to expand closer to the mountains and climate variability heightens, the threat of flooding remains a prevalent concern in LA county.
