William Mulholland’s reputation extended beyond the borders of Los Angeles, including cities across California. Those benefiting from the water he helped provide through the Los Angeles Aqueduct greatly admired him, showing reverence for the work he did. Mulholland’s humble origins as an Irish ditch digger make his transformation into one of the most prominent figures in LA’s history even more significant. His genius as a self-taught engineer makes his projects all the more impressive, and his renowned pragmatism made him a fascinating character. 


After the completion of the aqueduct from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles (which brought water from Central California to Southern California), Mulholland looked for another source of water to support the continuing rapid growth of the city’s population. He set his eyes on the Colorado River and planned an aqueduct able to supply for millions. However, his shining career was permanently stained by the tragic collapse of the St. Francis Dam that he oversaw construction of. This cost the lives of over 450 people, and he ultimately took full responsibility. He resigned from his position in 1928, giving his illustrious legacy a bitter end.


This primary source is a letter addressed to Mulholland from the Placentia Chamber of Commerce. Placentia, founded in 1837, is a city in Orange County, just under an hour drive away from Los Angeles. It’s rich agricultural history, particularly in relation to citrus fruits, is illustrated by its official incorporation in 1926 after being the center of Valencia Orange Growing and Packing. Cultivating citrus fruits is no dry feat; the University of Arizona estimates that it takes anywhere from 17-135 gallons of water per day (depending on the time of year) to support one citrus tree. In an area as lacking in rainfall like Southern California, it is no wonder that Placentia viewed Mulholland as their savior: his aqueduct helped sustain one of their primary products. 


The Placentia Chamber of Commerce’s genuine gratitude is wonderfully exemplified in this letter. Written in 1924, four years before the St. Francis Dam disaster, it addresses Mulholland in a highly respectful manner, humbly asking him to speak about the “Colorado river proposition or any other water subject” at their meeting.  It acknowledges his status as a busy man and takes a lowly position of possibly not being worth his time, giving him some semblance of a celebrity. The value Placentia places on Mulholland’s ideas is evident as they even provide an alternative request for him to send someone with similar policies if he could not make it.


This high esteem for Mulholland was by no means a universal sentiment at the time. In stark contrast, the people of Owens Valley, who Mulholland’s aqueduct took water from, held an entirely different set of opinions. In their eyes, Mulholland was a villain, stealing their resources and stripping their land from its natural splendor. They resented him for representing the scheming Los Angeles which took self-proclaimed priority over them. Not only did he take from the farmers that Los Angeles would mock in political cartoons, but he also took from the Paiute who had lived off the water for thousands of years. While this letter doesn’t show it, there is much more to Mulholland’s public perception than deserving praise and adoration. His popularity represents the triumph of those who did not consider how they derived benefit from the loss of others.
