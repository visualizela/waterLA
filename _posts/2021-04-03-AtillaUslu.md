The following document consists of two pages. The first page includes the general information regarding Colorado River Aqueduct, such as its length, estimated construction time, details regarding the bond issue, and the cities included in the agreement. This road map was built in 1935, during the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct.

The aqueduct was issued by The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which was founded in 1928. This organization was founded in the aim of finding solutions to the water problem in the Southern California district. Although they had some projects before 1931, their first large project was the Colorado River Aqueduct project, which started in 1931 and ended in 1941.

After the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the population of the city of Los Angeles increased dramatically. After the dramatic increase in population, the city of Los Angeles started to search for more water in order to maintain the growth of the city. As the land Los Angeles is at mostly dry, the city had to look elsewhere. There were some other projects, however the most crucial one came in 1931; Colorado River Aqueduct project. The image below shows the road map of the Colorado River Aqueduct. The maps include the main aqueduct, tentative distribution system, member cities, aqueduct road, state highways, and railroads, which can be found in the Legend part in the image. Additionally, by looking at the numbered circles, it is possible to see which company/organization was responsible for the corresponding part of the construction. Lastly, the part The Table of Distances represents the distance from the city of Los Angeles to the specified location in miles.

Compared to the project in Owens Valley, because the distance to the city is significantly higher, new technological methods were used(such as the pumping technique).

The image above is another map of Colorado River Aqueduct project, however this one is a more simple one compared to the Primary Document. Altough it is a less detailed map, it is easier to see the main path the of the Colorado River Aqueduct. In addition, the image contains important information regarding the pumping system: “5 pumping stations, which lift the water 1617 feet over the mountain barriers;”. As pointed out in the quote, there are 5 main pumping stations,which were used for the first time in Los Angeles water history.

The image above is a visual representation of the pumping system used in the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct. Specifically, the image is the pumping station of the system.

In conclusion, the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct was one of the crucial events in the water history of Los Angeles and California. After the it was open for usage, it helped city of Los Angeles to increase in population and therefore expand its surface area even more. Still in 2021, Los Angeles gets its 50% of water from the Colorado River built in 1941.
