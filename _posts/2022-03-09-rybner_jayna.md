One of the earliest pieces of major infrastructure within the water industry in California was the St. Francis Dam, a part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which was built to provide the surrounding county with water. Acting as a wall on the edge of the San Francisquito canyon, this dam formed a reservoir which stored water for the evergrowing Los Angeles (Jackson and Hundley). Just two years after its creation, in the early morning of March 12th, 1928, Tony Harnischfeger, the St. Francis dam keeper, noticed that there were small leaks occurring in the dam and notified the dam’s engineers (Wilkman, 75). The lead engineer, William Mulholland, a self-taught engineer, and his assistant came to assess the situation, but determined that there was no problem occurring. (Standiford, 249).  That night, on March 12th-13th, 1929, due to poor geological characteristics of the canyon in combination with engineering faults by Mulholland, it collapsed (Wilkman, 79). 12.4 billion gallons of water flooded through the Santa Clara River valley and Santa Paula, destroying everything in its path, including houses, schools, tents, and other structures. (Wilkman, 78). The St. Francis Dam disaster killed over 400 people and is the greatest civil engineering disaster in America’s history. (Jackson and Hundley).

Many survivors recall stories that describe surviving purely by luck, followed by the note that the same did not occur to those that they loved, and that they never saw their families again (Wilkman, 79). Many children were left orphaned, and many others lost their siblings, parents, grandparents, children, friends, and coworkers.

“Emergency morgue with bodies of victims of the flood that followed the failure of the Saint Francis Dam, Newhall (Calif.), 1928,” March 1928. There were too many victims for the county to manage, so emergency morgues had to be set up such as the one above.

While the death toll is officially 400-500 deaths, many believe that there were over 600 people who died in the disaster, due to the large numbers of Mexican-American undocumented migrant workers who worked in the region (Meares). Many bodies of the dam’s victims were buried under several tons of debris, and many others are believed to have been swept out to sea, so the true death toll will never be known.

In the photograph Children Gathered in Front of Tents after the Failure of the Saint Francis Dam and Resulting Flood, Santa Clara River Valley (Calif.), surviving children who appear to be of Mexican-American descent are seen in a relief camp created for homeless victims and relief workers. Little is known about their stories and fates, but they are part of the few survivors of the disaster. Many of these victims were the families of the workers that lived in camps along the Santa Clara River valley, who had only tents to protect them from the flood. Therefore, it is possible that some of those in the photograph are children of the undocumented workers killed in the disaster, who are missing from the records of history.
