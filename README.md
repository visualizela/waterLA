## Flâneur

Flâneur is a Jekyll theme for maps and texts using Leaflet, and based on the earlier [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework.

View the theme live [here](http://dawnchildress.com/flaneur).

To use this theme, fork this repo to your GitHub account and follow the setup instructions below.

**Update:** Flâneur will soon have **Leaflet-IIIF** functionality to allow the use of IIIF-hosted images in place of map tiles, using pixel corrdinates instead of lat,lng. Thanks to Jack Reed ([mejackreed](https://github.com/mejackreed)) for getting this started with his Leaflet-IIIF library. You can view the in-progress version in the "flaneur-iiif" branch.

### Config file

**Site settings:** You will want to replace the settings here with the info about your new site.

**Styles:** You can change the site accent color and font here without editing the CSS. You will still need to replace the Google Font import URL in `head.html`.

**Map settings:** Import a map tileset from MapBox, OpenStreetMap, etc. and set the max/min zoom and center point. You also have the option to choose clustered or single map points. Options are `grouped` or `single`.

**Menu:** There are two menu display options, `dropdown` (default) and `circle`.

### Posts
Create posts in the standard `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format required for Jekyll. The front matter for posts has several important liquid markup points:
* `lat:` & `lng:` add latitude and longitude to pin a post to a point on the map
* `categories:` ["category1", "category2"] - these populate the map layers widget and article index pages
* `runningtitle:` the running title appears at the top of pages and posts. The default is to display the site title. To activate the post-specific running title, you will need to uncomment line 6 in the post.html layout and comment out line 8:
```html
<!-- <p class="post-header">{{page.runningtitle}}</p> -->
<!-- OR -->
<p class="post-header">{{ site.title }}</p>
```
* `desc:` This is the text for the map marker popup

Images have special formatting using Liquid attributes. The Liquid tags are also needed for the Lightbox feature:
```md
![Image title](images/filename.jpg -or- imageurl)
   {:.image}
Image attribution / caption.
   {:.caption}
```
Bibliographies also have special formatting using Liquid attributes:
```md
{:.bibliography}
1. Entry 1
2. Entry 2
```
