"In the late 1920s and early 1930s Los Angeles was booming.  The population of southern California eclipsed northern California for the first time and “Los Angeles experienced the largest internal migration in the history of the American people as hundreds of thousands of people arrived by automobile.”  The aircraft and film industries took root in Los Angeles as they experienced massive growth and started the world’s love affair with Hollywood.  However, as with any good LA Story, the bright lights of the big city hid an underlying darkness, and this time it was water that stirred the nightmares of Angelinos."

"With the huge population boom, Los Angeles’ infrastructure was showing signs of stress and inadequacy.  Water became quite contentious and was the source of the “Water Wars” between the citizens of eastern California and southern California as the “irate residents of the Owens Valley, believing their water was being stolen, vented their anger against Los Angeles by dynamiting parts of the system.”  One component of the Owens River Aqueduct system was the newly built St. Francis Dam, just north of Los Angeles, which became operational in 1926."

"However, on March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam collapsed, sending a surge of water 10 stories tall more than 50 miles south through Los Angeles all the way to the Pacific Ocean, killing hundreds in its path."

"Prevention of another dam disaster took center stage within California after the St. Francis Dam disaster.  Dams were critical for water control and energy during the continuing population surge in the state and more were needed.  The lack of centralized, governmental control concerning dam oversite and inadequate engineering were determined to be the likely culprits of the collapse of the St. Francis Dam as an official inquiry by the Los Angeles County Coroner determined that the St. Francis Dam was defective “due to the very poor quality of the underlying rock structure upon which it was built and the fact that the design of the dam was not suited to inferior foundation conditions.”  The St. Francis Dam was a gravity dam, meaning that the pressure of the water pushed forward against the dam wall and then downwards into its foundation.  The original plans of the dam were for it to be only 175 feet tall, but it ultimately was built up to 195 feet tall.  Raising the height of the dam without increasing the thickness of its base was later determined to be a catastrophic engineering failure."  

"A letter entitled “Supervision of Dams in California for Protection of Life and Property,” was drafted two years after the St. Francis Dam disaster by Edward Hyatt, the new State Engineer of California, explaining the steps taken to prevent another dam collapse in California.  It was an impassioned letter calling out the incompetent advice the builders of the St. Francis Dam received from various decentralized governmental agencies that didn’t have adequate engineering skills, a defense of the new powers bestowed upon the State Engineer’s office that had to survive a court challenge by a dam builder who tried to remove them, and his plea that his impartial agency continue to rule over all dam construction projects to ensure that another California dam could not “create another public menace.”"

"Mr. Hyatt’s letter provided evidence of how these powers to protect the people were put to work in a fight over the originally proposed site of the San Gabriel Dam in 1930.  Mr. Hyatt put together an independent panel of experts to conduct an inquiry into the much-contested plans for the new San Gabriel Dam, which, if built, was large enough “to have created a menace to the San Gabriel Valley in case there were any doubt as to its stability.”  The appointed team of engineers investigated the plans and the site of the proposed San Gabriel Dam, presenting a report within 30 days to the State Engineer stating there was no doubt that the site was unsuitable for a dam."  

"The new powers at the disposal of the State Engineer to ensure ethical, skilled, and independent studies of all future dam projects likely prevented another Los Angeles disaster similar to the St. Francis Dam, allowing our LA story to have the happy ending its citizens deserve."
