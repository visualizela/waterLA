I chose a contour map of the Colorado river aqueduct construction from 1933. The Colorado river aqueduct was one of the largest projects in a progression of LA water infrastructure projects that helped transform LA into the sprawling metropolis it is today. The map shows how treacherous the journey was that the aqueduct had to take, indicative of LA’s burning aspirations for more water (Colorado Aqueduct Progress). These aspirations have a very long history. 
Historically, Los Angeles relied on the Los Angeles river for its water supply. As Blake Gumprecht, a chair of the Department of Geography at the University of New Hampshire, explains, “Water from the Los Angeles river...assured the city's emergence as the dominant city in Southern California.” (Gumprecht 107). However, with thousands of people flocking to the city due to railroad construction and advertising, and the Los Angeles river polluted and drained, Los Angeles needed more water.

William Mulholland, the famous LA water pioneer and chief engineer of the Bureau of water and power, looked towards the Owens river to get more water. They were willing to do whatever it took to get the water. After a mess of corruption, land grabs in Owens valley for water rights, and propaganda, the bond measure for the 225 mile aqueduct was approved (Standiford). 

In the 1920s, William Mulholland looked for a new water source again. Los Angeles continued to grow quickly and they needed another aqueduct. After surveying multiple locations, Mulholand pushed for the large and untamed Colorado river. Turning to the Federal government, they agreed to help finance the massive project as a part of great depression projects intended to stimulate the economy. Finally, the 220 million dollar bond measure was approved in 1931, and construction began on the ten year project. Particularly, the federal government funded the construction of the parker dam, which is where water was diverted from the Colorado river to the aquaduct. (Water and Power).

While Mulhollland was able to construct a gravity based aqueduct system that required no pumps for the LA aqueduct, the Colorado river aqueduct was an extremely different and more difficult project. At 242 miles long, the aqueduct has more than 90 miles of tunnels, 55 miles of cut-and-cover conduit, and five pumping stations (Colorado River Aqueduct). As shown by the archival contour map, the aqueduct has to traverse many mountains and valleys that were of varying elevations.

After its initial diversion at the Parker dam, the water is pumped up the Whipple mountains. Then, it flows through the Mojave desert until it arrives at the Iron and Eagle mountains, where the water is lifted multiple times.

A series of tunnels takes the aqueduct through the San Jacinto mountains. After some more tunnels and canals, the aqueduct finally reaches its holding reservoir near Riverside (Colorado Aqueduct Progress). 
This project cost lives and millions of dollars, but it also showed LA’s determination to remain the premier city on the west coast. Mulholland, Eaton, and other Los Angeles water titans dedicated their lives to bringing water to Los Angeles, and transformed the city from a tiny pueblo to an iconic megacity.
