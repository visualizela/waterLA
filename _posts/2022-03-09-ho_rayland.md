This manuscript, titled Los Angeles-Owens Valley Water Controversy. Resolution of Inyo County Federation of Women's Clubs, was written in 1923 as a complaint detailed by residents of Owens Valley after the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. It summarizes the events that transpired in Inyo County, in chronological order, and shows the corruption behind the scenes that lead to the downfall of Owens Valley. 

The first couple pages of the manuscript describe what Owens Valley looked like after the city of Los Angeles diverted water from the Owens River to LA through the aqueduct. There were “tens of thousands of acres” of abandoned lands, including homes, schools and ranches due to the lack of irrigated land. These lands could not be easily repurposed, as there were no other resources for its use. The lake itself completely dried out in 1926, leaving only a crater of salt in the ground. This area was thus transformed into a salt mine.

Afterwards, the manuscript briefly describes procedures that demonstrate Owens Valley residents’ resistance to LA’s changes. An Irrigation District was set up to outvote support for LA - and that it did. The Irrigation District was organized by a vote of 599 for and 25 against, showing nearly unanimous support for Owen Valley. In fact, only 8 free agents out of 202 stockholders supported the City’s plans for the looting of water from Owens Valley; it was likely that they were either paid off or working under the city of LA.

The middle pages of the manuscript go into the deception employed by the city of LA to gain control of water rights in Owens Valley. Not only did LA covertly gain control of the National Reclamation Service, but the city also used that power to secure land and rights from Owens Valley citizens. Going further, LA informed its citizens that the water was secured through a “fair bargain and sale” - neither of which were true. Newspapers that tried to print the truth, such as the Los Angeles News, were forcefully pushed out of business.

To add on, the manuscript informs that there was a great deal of insider trading that led to the overtaking of Owens Valley. Many of the rich elite bought up San Fernando land that they knew would be sold for river rights before the land had even hit the market. Composed of big names such as Fred Eaton, Harrison Gray Otis and Henry E. Huntington, this group of wealthy investors became known as the Syndicate.
It’s sweet that the ending paragraphs of the manuscript are meant to dehostilize the tension between the city of Los Angeles and the citizens of Owens Valley. Even though they have every reason to be outraged, the Owens Valley residents remain civil and respectful. They even approach with different solutions to Los Angeles’ water issues, such as a 150 foot dam in Long Valley, so that both counties could live in peace and harmony.
