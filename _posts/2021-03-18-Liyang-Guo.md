Los Angeles has a long and rich history with its relationship with water. From the small pueblo town, to becoming the Southern Vineyard, to eventually to a metropolis. Every major change and development of Los Angeles can always be traced back to its relationship with water.
When the domestic water source, the LA river, proved to be insufficient, LA began to look elsewhere to get more water.   First of those efforts is the LA River Aqueduct. However, this was not enough, or at least that is what LA believed. By 1930, LA citizens approved another bond issue to bring more water, called the Mono Basin Extension. Despite those efforts, LA still wants citizens to believe there still is dire need of water.
Not long after, more propagandas are made to urge citizens to vote yes for a new bond for the construction of the Colorado River aqueduct.

This primary document is a newspaper article published on August 14 of 1931, from the Southern California Trojan, a USC student newspaper. In it, a piece called the Aqueduct is Insurance Policy encourages its reader to approve the Colorado river aqueduct.

The article included quotes from experts that favor the construction, reassuring the reader that the new tax would be minimal, and the benefit for LA is huge. At the same time, it warned that not approving the construction will cause a water shortage. The article is trying to sway the readers to vote for the construction. This article is significant to LA’s water history because it is a reflection on how crucial water is to LA, and the extent LA would push to get this construction approved.
The article made a very clear distinction on the future of LA. With the aqueduct built and more water flowing into LA, LA can continue to grow and prosper, like it always had been. However, if the aqueduct is not built, that would mean a water shortage and insecurity for LA. This would make LA an unpleasant place to live, and greatly hurt LA’s growth and wealth. It showed that LA is a city built on top of its water resource, and LA would crumble if it was out of water.
The vote for the construction is open to all citizens; therefore, the fact that it appeared in a student newspaper means the mainstream ones are already saturated with more propaganda. It did not stop with newspapers; the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California even made a short film, THIRST ,  encouraging the viewer to approve the vote.

The overwhelming propagandas, paired with the desire for a new project due to the Great Depression, outweighs the few skepticism, like the fact that LA needs to approve another water project just one year later. The Colorado Aqueduct is approved, and LA secured another major source of water, even if LA might not need it at the time. In the end, LA is still a city built on top of water, and securing this aqueduct cemented its ability to become the metropolis it is today.
