Los Angeles’s quest for water in the late-1800s and early-1900s was surprisingly not peaceful and smooth, but rather turbulent, problematic, and at times even violent. The archival photograph below highlights a tense standoff between the city of LA and protestors, from the Owens Valley, at the Alabama Gates part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The picture was taken by Detrick Bishop in November of 1924.

The altercation began when a group of 60 outraged Owens Valley ranchers and farmers seized the Alabama Gates by violently threatening and kicking out the guards. Then, they proceeded to open the gates and let water flow into the Owens riverbed, which had dried up from extensive diversions. News of the takeover spread and soon over 700 Owens Valley residents came to Inyo County to protest. As the picture depicts, protestors blocked the gate’s entrance, preventing LA officials from closing the gates to the Owens River. After 5 days, the standoff came to an end when a mediation panel, with 3 state judges, was created to resolve the claims of the Owens Valley residents. Claims that were made due to multiple hardships residents faced from one root cause: the LA Aqueduct.

In order to understand what provoked the anger of the Owens Valley residents, we must backtrack and review LA’s water journey. From the mid-to-late 1800s, LA began to transform from a small-pueblo to bustling city of commerce and industry. However, with it arose the issue of water shortages. Fred Eaton and William Mulholland, innovators of water development in LA, devised a plan to outsource water from the Owens Valley via an aqueduct. The city rapidly bought up land and water rights in the valley. Federal assistance, secret partnerships, and the lack of structured land-ownership were all used by LA to explicitly override the pre-existing water rights held by the Owens Valley residents. The land grab was sneaky, deceitful, and insincere.

Construction of the LA aqueduct began promptly afterwards, and was completed in 1913. Pictured above is a dredger and crane construction site near the Owens Valley. LA brought in industrial equipment and began to physically disrupt the valley.

In the decade following the completion of the LA Aqueduct the Owens Valley faced significant environmental and economic downfalls. According to Inyo County Water Department diversions of water to the city caused the Owens River to fall and eventually dry up, which severely decreased the valley’s water supply. Agriculture, the valley’s main industry, deeply suffered without adequate irrigation water. Local businessmen experienced large cuts in income and land value. Furthermore, the population decreased by 20% in certain regions and multiple schools had to be consolidated. Resident’s in the Valley hoped that the city would reimburse them for the financial hardships caused by the aqueduct. However, the city of LA was adamant that no reparations were due. After years of turmoil, valley residents decided to make a bold statement to the city by charging the Alabama Gates, starting the famous standoff we analyzed in the first archival photograph. Although the standoff solely lasted 5 days, it garnered state-wide and national media coverage. Most importantly, it unveiled the destructive and unethical side of LA’s glorified quest for water.
