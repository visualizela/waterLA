Sixth Street Bridge, also known as Six Street Viaduct was built in 1932 and served as an important transportation cross for neighborhoods outside of downtown Los Angeles in the East LA/ Boyle Heights area. The Seventh Street Bridge was built in 1910 as a trolley bridge in Los Angeles' early dates of suburban expansion.

The night before, storm clouds grew over Southern California, and temperatures dropped nearly 10 degrees. (LA Times, 1952) Los Angeles's USC and Downtown Areas recorded up to 7 inches of rain on that night alone leading into the morning. At the time, Los Angeles was going through its periodic dry spell. The previous year showed only 4 inches of rain year-round.

Los Angeles sits at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains in a desert region that has been exponentially growing since the transportation of outside water from other sources. In February 1914, one year after the construction Los Angeles Owens River Aqueduct, LA was devastated by another storm. This pressured city officials to create the beginning of the flood control program we see today. The flood of 1914 brought critical attention to Los Angeles's lack of flood control infrastructure, prompting the city to create the County Flood District. The first step in flood control was deepening, widening, and straightening the Los Angeles River and its tributaries. Thought to be permanent flood control efforts, the earlier methods were levees reinforced by concrete walls or riprap, constructed to line parts along the river's banks. 
On New Year's day 1934, Los Angeles suffered another major flood bringing national attention to Southern California's flooding issue and prompting future flood control infrastructure change. Los Angeles, shortly after, requested $19.3 million in assistance relief under the Emergency Relief Plan. Construction began in August of 1935, and by 1936, an additional $3 million was granted to Los Angeles. 
Construction had not been completed in March of 1938 when a week-long rainstorm ravaged through southern California, delivering 6.3 inches of rain just within twenty-four hours. The flood created nearly $17 million in damage. It killed 45 people in the city alone. A total of $78 million in destruction and eighty-seven people died in Los Angeles County.
The flood in 1938 proved previous flood control worked and prevented some damage. However, this changed officials’ plans to then channelize the entire Los Angeles River to avoid further inundation of homes and property.
Within the next two years, LA Flood Association envisioned an extensive flood control project to channelize the Los Angeles River, raise bridges, deepen and widen tunnels. Between 1938 Channelization began in 1938 on smaller sections efforts from previous floods. By 1960, the project was completed, forming a fifty-one-mile concrete waterway.
