The primary source is a photo of the St. Francis Dam ruins by Charles H. Lee taken between 1928 and 1967 at the St. Francis Dam, which was in the Santa Clarita Valley. It shows the dam failure and the flood damage of the dam which was overseen and designed by Los Angeles engineer William Mulholland. This dam failure was so significant because it was designed by Mulholland, the brilliant engineer who built the Los Angeles aqueduct and brought water to the people of LA. He had the trust of the citizens as well as Los Angeles water officials, who allowed him to conduct the St. Francis Dam project without being overseen or checked. Because of this exception that Mulholland was allowed, there were large flaws in the engineering design that should have been noticed before any damage was done and lives were lost.

The intention behind the construction of the St. Francis Dam was good, as it was to better the lives of the people of Los Angeles. “Because of the rapid growth and droughts in the area, Mulholland sought alternatives for backup reserves of water” (“The Story of the St. Francis Dam”). Mulholland had much support from his construction of the Los Angeles aqueduct, which earned him a spot in the hearts of the citizens of LA. He became a leader in the engineering community, and rose through the ranks of Los Angeles Water and Power after on-site experience and self teaching from books. He was known to produce projects under budget and ahead of schedule (“The Story of the St. Francis Dam”).

The incredible amount of damage and destruction occurred because of lack of attention to detail and failure to account for changes in planning. In the design for the dam, there was little regard for site-specific investigations. “When these plans were finalized and after construction began, the height of the dam was raised by ten feet on two separate occasions in order to provide additional reservoir storage needed to sustain the growing community surrounding the dam. Although these modifications increased the dam’s height by twenty feet, no changes were made to its base width” (Association of State Dam Safety Officials). Because of this, the structural stability decreased significantly. Mulholland and his team were aware of this, but the additional cost of materials and extended construction time to properly account for the height increase were considered to be too costly. At the time, Mulholland and his team did not realize the impact of their actions on the structural integrity of the dam itself. “Once water is impounded behind a dam, the great weight of that water presses not only forward, but downward, exerting great pressure on underground water unavoidably percolating beneath the bottom of the dam itself. Today, no such dam would be built, but some analysts contend that such science was not fully understood at the time” (Standiford 239). This structural failure could be attributed to the time period, but Mulholland should have been overseen and there should have been an effort to redesign the entire dam after the changes to the height were made. Mulholland’s reputation allowed him to move forward without supervision which is completely unacceptable. A loss of infrastructure is unfortunate, but a loss of life is intolerable. “At least four hundred people were killed in the deluge, and property damage was in the many millions of dollars” (Deverell & Sitton 110).

The extent to which this dam failure impacted Los Angeles was huge. There were many new rules and regulations implemented in dam and other infrastructure construction, as well as the death of Mulholland’s reputation. He was not only disliked by others, he disliked himself and hid away for the remainder of his life out of embarrassment. The St. Francis Dam is a reminder of the loss and destruction resulting from high hopes and carelessness. The primary source photo shows the dreadful ruins which have since been removed because of their depressing nature.
