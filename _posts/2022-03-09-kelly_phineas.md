The image above is a photograph of flood control modifications being made to the Arroyo Seco stream, north of downtown Los Angeles, which feeds into the LA river. In the photo, the laborers are dwarfed by the size of the riverbed, indicating the enormous scope of the construction project.

Though the LA area is often depicted as an oasis in the desert, the city of Los Angeles has had a long history of catastrophic flooding, which often produces deadly results. The significant altitude of the San Gabriel mountains to the east of LA causes winter storms to be pushed to higher elevations, condensing and releasing precipitation. The steep slopes and shallow mountain soil prevent most of this precipitation from entering the groundwater supply, instead flowing into the coastal plain through the tributaries of the LA river (Gumprecht, 14). One of the major tributaries is the Arroyo Seco, north of downtown Los Angeles. Floods have plagued settlers near the Arroyo Seco river since the beginning of human presence in Los Angeles; the members of the first Spanish surveying expedition in Southern California in 1769 “found trunks of numerous trees on the banks of the [Los Angeles] river near its confluence with the Arroyo Seco” (Gumprecht, 131), indicating that the supposedly tame river experienced significant flooding during periods of heavy rain. Despite these risks, the Arroyo Seco canyon formed by the river has served as an important transportation corridor between Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley throughout the history of human settlement in Los Angeles. The advent of the Santa Fe transcontinental railroad in the late 1800s connected the San Gabriel Valley to the city of LA and caused urban land development to expand into the San Gabriel Valley. Land developers in Southern California promoted light rail systems between Pasadena and Los Angeles, which were developed to encourage a growing suburban population of commuters (Electric Railroad History Association of Southern California [ERHA], 1), as seen in Image 2.

The electric rail system was supported by land developers in Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, who encouraged prospective homeowners to work in the city and live in the country. This concept of commuting to work from the suburbs was one of the first symptoms of the “urban sprawl” that LA would later become famous for.

The first comprehensive attempt to control floodwaters in the Arroyo Seco began after the devastating flood of 1917, which led to the founding of the LA County Flood Control District. The construction of Devil’s Gate Dam in 1920 was the organization’s first completed project; the dam, built just north of Pasadena, was designed to reduce severe levels of mountain runoff during heavy rain (LA County Public Works [LACPW]), shown in Image 3. Urban development exploded throughout the Los Angeles area in the 1920s-1940s, which increased strain on flood control infrastructure throughout the region. This pressure culminated with severe floods in both 1934 and 1938, severely impacting the communities around the Arroyo Seco. The 1938 flood was especially catastrophic for the city of Los Angeles, causing “the loss of 87 lives and damage estimated at $78,602,000” (Troxell et. al., 1), making it the most destructive flood in Los Angeles on record (Water and Power Associates). The damage from this flood prompted even more extensive flood control projects to be constructed through a city partnership with the Works Progress Administration, a federal Depression-era infrastructure program, which set aside millions of dollars for more comprehensive flooding controls in LA. These projects included the channelization of the Arroyo Seco, lining the riverbed with concrete to reduce groundwater saturation, which was completed alongside the Arroyo Seco Parkway–one of the earliest automobile freeways constructed in the United States.

The dam was completed in response to demands for more organized water control projects following damaging floods earlier in the decade. Today, the accumulation of sediment behind the dam has created an increased flooding risk to the surrounding area, creating the need for excavation crews to manually remove the buildup (LACPW).
