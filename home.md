title: "Water in Los Angeles"
---

Los Angeles is the second most populous city in America, yet has only modest local water supplies and straddles a river prone to periodic catastrophic flooding. How did this seemingly unsuitable landscape come to support an economically robust, densely populated metropolis? Students in Dr. Audra Bardsley’s GESM 130 class spend the semester examining the extraordinary engineering feats, people, and policies that brought water to thirsty Southern California and tamed the unpredictable Los Angeles River – along with environmental and social justice issues that have developed as a result.

To better understand the water system modifications that allowed for development of LA as it exists today, students explored digitized archival materials: photos, letters, reports, newspaper articles, pamphlets, and more from LA’s days as a Spanish pueblo to a burgeoning city on the verge of WWII. The articles that you see here feature those materials and provide historical context for their importance to LA’s water history.
