"William Mulholland’s St. Francis Dam, opened originally in 1926, was created as an extension for Los Angeles’ water reservoir. Located in the San Francisquito Canyon, the dam was meant to supply 32,000 acre-feet of water for the city."

"Shortly after construction began, though, Mulholland realized that the dam would not be large enough to support all of the water and chose to raise the height, changing the dam’s thickness as compensation. However, due to the lack of sufficient clayey materials in the soil, the gravity arch dam was not stable enough to support the new weight. Mulholland and his companions didn’t know it at the time, *“the raising of the height of a gravity dam without a corresponding increase in the thickness of its base [was] dangerous,”* and minute cracks and leaks began to form *(Standiford)*. When the dam operator brought up his concerns about an impending blowout on the dam on Monday, March 12, 1928, Mulholland brushed off the concerns, saying that it was normal and since the water was clear, the cracks were not an issue."

"However, later that night, the dam broke, and the aqueduct’s water was dumped into the San Francisquito Creek, *“with an initial depth of 140 feet above the streambed” (Rogers)*. Not long after, *“At 12:03 a.m., according to the official report written by an independent commission, the ‘liquid avalanche’ took out the concrete Powerplant #2, crushing it ‘as easily as an eggshell’” (Blitz)*. In total, the floodwaters traveled about 52 miles with an official death toll of 432, most from being crushed by boulders, timber, and machinery. Because of the mass destruction, **179 of the official victims’ bodies were never found**."

"The St. Francis Dam disaster effectively ended Mulholland’s career. Survivors and those who were affected by the tragedy quickly turned against him, and _“A woman who lost her entire family posted a sign that read, in dripping red paint, ‘**Kill Mulholland!**’” (Roderick)_. Although Mulholland was judged by the court to be not at fault for the disaster, the jury ruled that “The construction of a municipal dam should never be left to the sole judgment of one man, no matter how eminent” (Roderick). Mulholland’s spirit was broken and he blamed himself for the casualties, eventually resigning from his position as Chief Engineer of the Los Angeles Water Department on November 14. 1928. The incident at the St. Francis Dam was the first and last black spot on Mulholland’s record, and marked the end of the 50-year long era of his service to Los Angeles’ water systems."

"Today, the wreckage of the dam remains as the St. Francis Dam Disaster Site, serving as a memorial to those who were killed by the tragedy. The St. Francis Dam National Memorial Foundation is currently working on a potential National Memorial Visitor Center and national monument, but plans have not yet been finalized. Until then, the site remains as a popular hiking destination, where visitors can explore the dam’s wreckage and history."
