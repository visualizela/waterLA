This letter from E. Duryea to William Mulholland was from May, 1906. The letter contains information regarding Mr. Duryea showing his interest in visiting the Owens River with Mr. Mulholland and providing Mulholland with some suggestions. The letter also gives some insight on the relationship between Reclamation Service officers and the LADWP.

In the early 1900s, Los Angeles was experiencing rapid growth in scale of the city, as well as population. The development caused serious pressure on the original water source of L.A.--the L.A. River, and it was almost drained to dry. Knowing that the city was looking for additional water supply, the former mayor of L.A., Fred Eaton suggested to the chief engineer of L.A. Department of Water and Power, William Mulholland, that the Owens River would be an available choice. 

Reclamation Service, a federal agency in charge of water resource management, would have potentially blocked the water rights of the city of L.A. However, J. B. Lippincott, an official from Reclamation Service, worked as a double agent for Reclamation Service and the LADWP, giving Eaton the opportunity to purchase the land in Owens Valley by hiring him to “assist” with Reclamation Service investigation and giving him the letter of recommendation from the federal agency, thereby granting L.A. water right to construct the L.A. Aqueduct.

E. Duryea was apparently a member of the Reclamation Service, since he mentioned Chief Engineer Newell in his letter, who was the director of Reclamation Service at the time. Duryea mentioned he had interest in investigating the Owens Valley with Mulholland, yet kept emphasizing that the visit was a “recreation trip” and was “unofficial”, and he would not “take pay for any assistance”. This proves that Duryea potentially was also acting as a double agent to some degree, helping Mulholland make judgements on the Valley while still working for Reclamation Service. The letter also demonstrates how respected Mulholland was at the time considering Duryea was willing to “give up my position here and undertake the work you propose”.

With a total length of 225.87 miles across deserts, the Los Angeles Aqueduct connecting the Owens River and Los Angeles was completed. The L.A. Aqueduct has given service to the city of L.A. since November 1913 as Mulholland announced to the city “There it is--take it!”. The L.A. Aqueduct further encouraged the rapid growth of the city of Los Angeles. The population of the city increased from 102,479 in 1900 to 576,673 in 1920, which was 5 years after the Aqueduct started sending water to the households. It also greatly increased the value of land in the San Fernando Valley since the water passes through the area, rendering the real estate speculation of Syndicate, a group formed by extremely rich businessmen who bought up the land in San Fernando Valley, extremely successful.
