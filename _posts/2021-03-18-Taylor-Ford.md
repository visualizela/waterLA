The conflict surrounding flooding issues came to an unfortunate climax in 1934, when Los Angeles yet again faced complete and utter natural destruction. Fires had plagued the area in the end of 1933, which made the ground more susceptible to landslides. People continued to build in these disaster prone areas, so when Los Angeles received heavy rains the following year, many homes were at risk. The flood of 1934 destroyed over two-hundred homes, eight-hundred cars, and killed one-hundred people. Bridges and roads were destroyed and thousands of people were displaced from the damage. This was obviously not the first instance of destructive flooding in Los Angeles, but it marked a pivotal moment in terms of the push for flood control. Citizens were terrified of the impending doom of the next flood and the possibility of losing their home or their life. This photo illustrates the aforementioned damage; showing demolished homes, cars, and streets.

This photo again emphasizes the damage of the horribly destructive flood of 1934. It is an authentic depiction of the damage that would be inflicted on homes after floods such as these and prior to increased flood control efforts. The home shown here is representative of the many homes lost to uncontrolled flooding. Los Angeles faced significant pressure in the 1930s to improve their infrastructure surrounding floods and their effects because of the overwhelming and prevalent danger they imposed on the public.

Between 1815 and 1941, Los Angeles faced several drastic and extremely destructive floods. These floods destroyed farmland, wiped away homes, and some even killed people and livestock. One of the most notable of the earlier floods occurred in 1862, deemed “The Great Flood.” To date, this is the largest flood that Los Angeles has ever experienced. The scene of complete and utter devastation that was left in its wake garnered a lot of attention and Los Angeles began looking at the flood control infrastructure of other cities. This photo shows the extent of the flooding in the streets of LA. In some areas, citizens had to travel in small boats to get places because of the height of the water in the roads.
