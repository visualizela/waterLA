Hand-drawn profile of the Los Angeles Aqueduct created by the Los Angeles Water Department during construction, demonstrating the aqueduct's downstream trajectory and some of the extreme landforms it traversed. Tunnels were built throughout the mountainous parts of its course and its downstream path allowed electricity generation with gravity, making it one of the greatest engineering feats at the time.

“The immense water resources of Owens Valley commanded my attention at once.” These words, uttered by Fred Eaton in 1892 after his visit to Owens Lake, are what inspired William Mulholland to relentlessly take on the challenge of building the 226 mile Los Angeles Aqueduct through rugged and desolate land in the early 20th century. 

Water was beginning to look scarce in Los Angeles, as by 1902 the Los Angeles River, the city’s major water source, became dry about 8 months of the year. For 10 straight days in July of 1904, the city’s consumption of water exceeded inflow into its reservoirs by almost 4 million gallons. The population of Los Angeles was growing faster than ever and was predicted to continue growing exponentially for decades. In order to continue its growth, Mulholland, head of the Los Angeles Water Department at the time, knew it was imperative for the city to secure a reliable and abundant source of water.
 
Located at a higher elevation than Los Angeles, Mulholland figured that an aqueduct from Owens Lake would provide the city water for decades to come. Though Mulholland, who was to be in charge of the building of the Los Angeles aqueduct, had no formal education in any sort of engineering, he had earned the respect of the people of Los Angeles, as he had already made many impressive and necessary strides to help Los Angeles become the city that it was at the time. Thus, it comes to little surprise that residents of Los Angeles overwhelmingly approved a bond issue to start building the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1905. 

The people’s appreciation for Mulholland and his work was not for no reason. Mulholland was a brilliant engineer, and his genius showed through in his building of the Los Angeles aqueduct. Since it flowed almost entirely downstream, not only was the Aqueduct the first of its kind to be entirely powered by gravity but it also produced hydroelectric power for the city at little cost. The aqueduct’s first power plant, Power Plant One, opened in 1917 in the Owens Valley division of the reservoir, and, at the time, provided over 70% of power for the city of Los Angeles. Seven more power plants were to be constructed on the aqueduct, now serving approximately 122 megawatts of energy combined, enough electricity for 179,000 homes. 

Additionally, many tunnels had to be constructed in order for water of the aqueduct to successfully cross numerous mountainous regions, such as within the Jawbone and Grapevine divisions of its trajectory, without an external powering source. Not only did the tunnels throughout the aqueduct require intense planning, but they were also very consuming to build. The longest tunnel of the aqueduct, the Elizabeth Tunnel, (located in the Elizabeth division of the aqueduct) took four and a half years to complete, and spanned over five miles. In total, 142 tunnels were constructed for the aqueduct, collectively spanning forty-three miles in length. 

The Los Angeles aqueduct finally opened in 1913, after over 6 years of construction as one of the most brilliant and effective engineering accomplishments of its time.
