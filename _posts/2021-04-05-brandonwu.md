In 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed, creating connections from east coast to west coast in the United States. With the government's promotion of the west coast, the american dream of creating a fortune in the west, and the convenience to travel, more and more people were moving to the west, especially Los Angeles. In face of the growing population in Los Angeles during the late 1800s and early 1900s, more and more water was demanded for various needs of people. William Mulholland, the head of Los Angeles Water Department at that time, recommended building the Los Angeles Aqueduct, diverting water from the Owens Valley to the City of LA, which later proved an important infrastructure for the future growth of Los Angeles. 

Rainfall in Los Angeles, from observation of its pattern, was never stable and could not provide people with continuous access to water if there was a drought during some years. The LA River often dried up in summer and flooded in winter due to winter storms. Therefore, it was clear that the City of LA needed another source of water. Fred Eaton, a former superintendent of the water company in LA, told Mulholland that Los Angeles would one day get its water supply from the Owens Valley. Mulholland initially thought Eaton was joking. However, later he found out that Eaton was right. Despite the long distance to transport the water, the downhill from the Owens River to Los Angeles made it possible to easily transport huge amounts of water without the use of any sort of water pumping technique. He then retraced the route from Owens Valley to LA several times and checked elevation and the flow rates of tributaries of the Owen River. Eventually, he was able to convince the water commissioners that the plan of constructing the LA Aqueduct would work and passed the bond to finance the plan.

After Mulholland secured the finance of the plan and central government’s support and obtained the water rights at the Owens Valley through the help of Fred Eaton, the construction of the LA Aqueduct began. From the picture above, we could see that the construction mainly took place in areas that were desert-like and undeveloped. The working environment was extremely harsh since it gets scorching hot during daytime and gets excruciating cold at night. To encourage people to work on the construction of the Aqueduct, Mulholland had to give workers bonus money and reduce their working time. In spite of the challenges of the harsh working environment and the hardship of transporting huge barrels of the aqueduct, the whole construction was still able to be completed within five years. Moreover, it was kept under the budget of about twenty-three million dollars, which was a fairly small amount of money for the scale of this construction. 

In 1913, the LA Aqueduct was completed. The city hosted a ceremony as seen in the picture above. A lot of people were there celebrating the success of its construction; however, it took nearly a year and a half after the ceremony for the water to finally come from the Owens River to Los Angeles. A century later, the Los Angeles Aqueduct continues to be a major source of water for the city of Los Angeles, which provides an average year supplying 29% of the water needs for almost four million people.
