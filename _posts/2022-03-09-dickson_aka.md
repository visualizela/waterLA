Tons of Debris, mud, and rocks had already started accumulating in Pickens Canyon along the small dams and water pipes, one of which is shown in the image below, which eventually gave way due to the intense tension of the waste and trash. This resulted in the New Year's Day Flood of 1934 which took place in La Crescenta, California just minutes after midnight took the lives of many individuals, there were about 100 deaths and many homes and property were destroyed as well. Men and children are standing in the aftermath of the flood next to the broken pipes and dams. Many people were left homeless and the mud from the flooding was deep enough that cars and some properties were buried underneath it. Communities of La Canada, like La Crescenta, Montrose, and Tujunga were affected by the tons of mud and debris flow that poured from the mountain during the disastrous flooding. 

Although the flood that took place on New Year 1934 was horrendous, LA is no stranger to flooding. Up until now, there have been many incidents of flooding that have taken place throughout the history of LA. Especially throughout the development of LA starting as a small pueblo, there have been periodic floods that have happened partly because the river was somewhat uncontrollable back then, and on top of that rainstorms and heavy rainfall would cause the rivers to overflow past their banks and spread onto the land. A traveler who witnessed the floods back in 1884 recalls that during the rainy season, the water would enlarge into a broad river and overflow over its banks, and would destroy countless possessions, property, and land. In the transition to an urban metropolis, the flooding intensified as the population started to grow and development expanded. Most of the construction and development that was done was on areas adjacent to streams and lakes requiring that levees, which prevented flooding were erected, trees were removed and openings were cut for the purpose of irrigation. Increased development such as transportation like the transcontinental railroad also contributed to the flood patterns as it ended up disrupting the natural flow of drainage which is essential for flood protection.


Los Angeles is also a victim of flooding due in part to its topography. Mountains, such as the San Gabriel Mountains have been a big factor since their steep slopes cause enormous amounts of runoff to come down in streams and on the land. The San Gabriel Mountains would often receive high inches of rain annually because LA has geographic rainfall that causes heavy precipitation to take place and since the San Gabriel Mountains are twice the height of other mountains, they are able to intercept a lot of rainfall. Mountains, especially the San Gabriel mountains would essentially be made of rocks like granite, and the mountain peaks which are made from granite cause heavy erosion to take place that results in tons of mud, clay, small particles, and debris accumulating and building upon the mountains. 

In the case of the New Year's Day Flood, there was a lot of heavy rainfall and especially brush fires that took place that led to the destruction of the areas along the mountains. Wildfires burn areas along the mountain causing the ground to become barren and less permeable. After the fires destroy the area, heavy rainstorms follow making it nearly impossible to absorb water into the soil allowing for mud and debris flow leading to destructive floods that end up destroying places. That is why there is a slight association between debris flows and wildfires and floods in the San Gabriel Mountains and/ or mountains in general.

As an aftermath of the calamity that took place on New Years' Day 1934, blame was placed on the defeat of the bond issues that would have provided money for flood construction in the area where damage was susceptible. As a result, there was demand from the public that called for federal aid in flood-prone areas in which Los Angeles County officials turned to the Federal Government for assistance. A plan for flood control prevention projects went underway, all that was needed was the funding. Some of the funding was provided by President Franklin Roosevelt and some were required by the county to pay up. In 1936, a Flood Control Act was passed that called for investigations and improvements of waterways throughout the nation for flood control purposes under the US Army Corps of Engineers who were given the responsibility. Ultimately, after the disastrous flood of 1934, significant steps were taken for flood control planning.
