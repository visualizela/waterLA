"In the early 20th century, the city of Los Angeles was experiencing near exponential growth; people were moving into Los Angeles at a rapid pace and for numerous reasons whether it be for the lush orange fields and orchards, the promise of paradise, or the ease of travel with the use of the transcontinental railroad which stretched from the city all the way to Kansas. However, with such rapid, unprecedented growth for Los Angeles, city officials began having concerns over one vital source: water."

"For the past few years, the city of Los Angeles had experienced periods of prolonged drought, usually lasting around 4-6 years. Usually, this was no cause for concern; it was an established pattern at that point, with heavy rainfall following the drought before the cycle would start again in the next few years. However, with LA’s quick population growth, the drought became more of a concern. Furthermore, increased population would mean that the water in the Los Angeles River watershed would decrease at a faster rate and eventually run out."

"As such, in 1904, the Board of Water Commissioners contacted multiple engineers to look for a new source of water for the city; among those engineers was William Mulholland. At the suggestion of his friend Fred Eaton, in March 1905, Mulholland informed the board that the future of LA’s water rested in the Owens Valley. The board followed through with this information and in the following year, submitted an application to begin construction on an aqueduct from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. The entire construction process, although messy and a bit shady, went fairly smoothly thanks to the help of three men: William Mullholand, Fred Eaton, and Joseph Lippincott."

"The entire process of construction for the Los Angeles Aqueduct was no easy feat; however, after meticulous planning for the structure, maneuvering through tricky water rights, and around six tough years of construction, the Los Angeles Aqueduct was finally completed in September of 1913."

"After six whole years, excitement surrounding the aqueduct and, more importantly, new water in Los Angeles, had reached its peak. As such, the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct on November 5, 1913 was considered an event of the highest caliber. It was a celebration, with music, fireworks, and 30-40 thousand people in attendance, ready to see the freshwater finally reach the San Fernando Valley. The atmosphere was electric and vibrant; it was joy in the purest sense. When the water finally hit Los Angeles, Mulholland exclaimed “There it is, take it!”"

"The Los Angeles Aqueduct opening was a monumental event in the history of Los Angeles. Not only did it secure the survival of Los Angeles and promote the idea of a prosperous future, but it also hailed a shift from LA’s early roots as a small pueblo with a series of irrigation ditches to a modern city with a complex water system."
