desc: "The Saint Francis Dam accident was one of the worst public works accidents in history. The Saint Francis Dam was built to increase the capacity Los Angeles had to hold extra water from the Owen's Valley. The Saint Francis Dam breach happened due to poor engineering judgement which led to the end of William Mulholland's successful career in water management."

William Mulholland played a vital role in the growth of Los Angles by organizing and arranging the aqueduct system from Owen’s Valley. After Mulholland had completed the aqueduct system, he was trying to build storage dams to contain all the water being diverted from the Owen’s Valley. One of these dams that he had built was the Saint Francis Dam located in the San Franquisto Canyon, 40 miles away from Los Angeles.
 
Mulholland set out to build a concrete gravity dam that would hold water coming from the Owen’s Valley. As Mulholland was a self-taught engineer, he used his skills to build this massive dam. He had determined that it was safe to build this dam. Mulholland built this dam based on his previously built dam named the Mulholland Dam located in the Hollywood Hills.
 
Mulholland had initially decided to build the dam with a height of 175 feet. The dam’s construction had started in 1921, and the building of the dam was going according to the laid out plans. During the building process, Mulholland had decided to raise the height of the dam to 195 feet to be able to hold up to 38,000 acre-feet of water. While adding this extra height to the dam, Mulholland failed to consider the effects of raising the height of the dam.
           
Mulholland eventually finished building the dam in March 1928 and deemed it structurally sound. When completed, the dam was 195 feet with a base width of 1,300 feet. The dam was able to hold 12.5 billion gallons of water after completion.
 
On March 12, Mulholland came to visit the dam to see how it was holding up after being filled with water. Tony Harnischfeger notified him on his visit to the dam that there was muddy water flowing out of the dam, but after Mulholland’s inspection, he deemed the dam to be in safe working condition.

On that same day, around midnight, the cracks in the dam grew too large, and the dam was breached. Water came rushing out of the dam into the surrounding areas, sweeping everything in the path of the water. There are witness accounts of people who claimed to hear the water rushing towards them and were unsure what to do, so they went outside to inspect what was going on. People were swept away by the water, houses were swept away, and nearly 7,000 acres of agricultural land were destroyed. Due to this dam disaster, about 400 people lost their lives, many of which could not be found as the water swept them away.

This one incident ended the extraordinary career that Mulholland had created for himself. He accepted full responsibility for his neglect in considering all the ramifications of raising the dam’s height. It was determined that the breach was attributed to his poor engineering judgment since he did not consider the full ramifications of raising the dam height without considering the necessary effects the soil underneath the dam. The soil that the dam was built upon could not withstand the pressure created by the water in the dam, which eventually led to this tragic downfall of William Mulholland and resulted in one of the most tragic public works accidents.
