During the 1880s, Los Angeles only had a population of around 11,000 people. In 1930, that population had grown to about 1.2 million people (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Historians attribute this growth to a variety of factors, with the importation of fresh, reliable, and inexpensive water from the Owens Valley through the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. However, with technology being a fraction of what it is today, how did engineers and construction workers manage to build a 200-mile aqueduct through desert and mountain terrain, with little to no infrastructure to support them?

William Mulholland (see fig. 2), the chief engineer for the LADWP, oversaw the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct as one of the most important construction projects of his life. A man known for his engineering skills and his objective lens on reality, he planned for the Los Angeles Aqueduct’s construction to go through both desert and mountainous terrain. Entire road and rail networks were built by nearby factories, new “Caterpillar” tractors (see fig. 3) were employed to haul supplies, and teams of mules (see fig. 1) were used to carry materials through rough and arid terrain (Water and Power Associates, 2021). Though both Caterpillar tractors and Mule teams were used to haul materials, Caterpillar tractors were phased out due to their unreliability and mule teams’ superior resistance to the Mojave Desert’s heat. Additionally, huge tunnels were driven through mountains as well as hydroelectric power plants and cement factories being built along the aqueduct’s route.

The siphons that were built (i.e. the pipes of the aqueduct itself) were enormous for the standards at the time, with an automobile being able to fit into the siphon’s width (see fig.4). One of the hardest siphons to build and complete was the Jawbone Siphon, which ran through both the Mojave Desert and tall summits. Additionally, the longest section of pipe crossed the Antelope Valley, with it being more than 20 thousand feet (Trinidad, KCET).

In February 1913, water was allowed to flow through the Aqueduct from its source, the Owens Valley, but water wouldn’t reach Los Angeles until several months later due to the enormous distance. In November 1913, a ceremony was held to commemorate the rush of water releasing into the San Fernando Valley, with 30,000 Los Angeles residents, politicians, and important figures being invited to the event (see fig. 5). Mulholland, during his speech, called out “There it is, take it,” marking the official welcome of imported water in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Times, 2013).

With Los Angeles receiving a surplus of cheap, reliable, and clean imported water, Los Angeles’ industry, housing, and agricultural markets flourished, attributing water to Los Angeles’ explosive population growth. During the 1940s, Los Angeles approved the construction of an extension to the Mono Lake Basin, providing more water to Los Angeles and its surrounding areas. Additionally, the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct and the state-approved State Water Project provided Los Angeles with more water, fueling Southern California to become a national cultural icon.
