The most important yet underappreciated resource on Earth is clean water. How would your life change if one day you turned on the faucet and all that came out was miniscule drops? This was the question that faced the city of Los Angeles in the early 20th century. By some, Los Angeles is commonly referred to as a dessert oasis (MacDonald) . To earn this name, city officials and engineers in 1907 were challenged to make the desert type lands of Los Angeles prosper, which required bringing in freshwater to aid development and an exponentially growing population. In the newspaper article titled, The Story of Owens River, the author Kelly Allen describes the process that ultimately led to Owens Valley being chosen as the location that Los Angeles would take water from. The article appears to be the introduction of Owens Valley to Los Angeles citizens. It highlights the thought process behind why Fred Eaton and William Mulholland decided to choose Owens Valley as their location to take water from. Additionally, the article proposes the aqueduct plans, including estimated cost and feasibility. This is extremely significant because not only did Mulholland have to find water to bring to Los Angeles, he also needed to gain the support of city officials and citizens to convince them to fund the project. Ultimately, with the help of Allen’s article, Los Angeles voters approved a $23 million bond that would allow for construction of the aqueduct to begin within the year (History.com). This money was vital as it was needed to fund the entire aqueduct project. With construction underway, Los Angeles now had the real potential of becoming one of the biggest and most developed cities in the United States. The once small pueblo of Los Angeles had now skyrocketed over its initial population and reached enormous heights, tallying in at just under one million people when the aqueduct was completed (“Historical General Population City & County of Los Angeles, 1850 to 2020”). This number would only continue to grow as Los Angeles developed due in large part to its new water source from the Owens valley. 

In the Owens Valley, the reaction to Allen’s newspaper article was not as positive as it was in Los Angeles. Due to what Owens Valley citizens saw as shady play and manipulation of their water rights, there were many riots that arose during and after the construction of the aqueduct. They felt that their water was unrightfully taken and that they needed some form of compensation. One of the most famous riots is considered to have taken place at the Alabama gates. In 1924, citizens of the Owens Valley took control of a portion of the aqueduct named the Alabama gates and began to divert the water back into the now dry Owens Valley river (“Alabama Gates Historical Marker”). This stand brought awareness to the suffering that was occuring in Owens Valley due to a lack of water. It also helps add to the situation as a whole, showing that in order for Los Angeles to prosper, other peoples and communities had to pay the consequences.

Highlighted in this photograph is a person testing water level in Owens Valley. Prior to the Los Angeles Aqueducts opening in 1913, the Owens Valley possessed a surplus of water. However, once LA began to divert water from Owens Valley the water supply dropped tremendously. In this image, we can see how low the water is compared to the marker used to observe the water level.
