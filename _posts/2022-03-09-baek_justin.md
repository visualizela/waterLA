The above image is a feature piece of the renowned William Mulholland pulled from a section of the Girard News. This tribute to Mulholland was created by other leading members of the San Fernando Valley to publicly display their appreciation and respect for Mulholland and prove to others that Mulholland was very much a leading engineer for the future.


Before his excellence was made known, Mulholland was like any other hardworking individual striving towards both their small and big life goals. Mulholland came from Dublin, Ireland at a fairly young age, and to keep himself active and busy, he worked multiple jobs. After exploring and trying to figure out his place and purpose, he ended up in California as a ditch tender for the Los Angeles City Water Company. Although he worked a very labor-intensive job, in his spare time after working, Mulholland would read books, learn about geology and engineering, and develop his love for these topics. Coincidentally, this passion for understanding more about the technical world had allowed him to be that much more diligent with his current work. His efforts did not go unnoticed, later being promoted to being in charge of the pipe-laying crew, and ultimately head engineer of large-scale water system projects, such as the Los Angeles Aqueduct (Standiford).


Soon enough, Los Angeles became a successful community, making the area popular to move and live in. Urban developments and attractive additions to the city included the railroad system, the expansion of agriculture such as citrus fruit, and general political and social advancements, showing people that Los Angeles was the place to live. Since these changes brought more people into the city, being able to sustain these people and provide them with their human needs, such as water, became a relevant topic of its own. With his knowledge of engineering, Mulholland took on the task of constructing the first Los Angeles Water Aqueduct, diverting the water from the Owens Valley, ultimately reaching the San Fernando Valley and other parts of the greater Los Angeles area. The people of the San Fernando Valley praised Mulholland as a hero who was able to increase the irrigated land from 3,000 acres to 75,000 acres (Los Angeles Times). Mulholland continued to receive the recognition he deserved, as he had just constructed one of the largest and most technical water systems. 


Although Mulholland has now become one of the leading figures in the water industry, Mulholland’s praise may have been brought about too early. Shortly after the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, Los Angeles was tasked to build the St. Francis Dam as a way to provide a storage reservoir for the Los Angeles Aqueduct water. Although Mulholland’s expertise allowed for a finished build, the dam was both physically weak and incompetent due to the fact it was build on inadequate soil, causing the dam to collapse the next day. Not only did this engineering loss cause physical damage to the surrounding area, but it also left many devastated. Due to this destructive event, Mulholland’s reputation isn’t just clearly defined by his successes anymore.
