On March 17, 1925 – almost one hundred years ago – a personal invitation was sent out, typeset in cordial font with a beautifully trimmed border. Set at two o’clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, March 17, 1925, reads this invitation from the Board of Public Service Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles inviting the receiving individual to attend the Dedication of the Mulholland Dam. Though this invitation may seem insignificant, it stands as a historical document that defines an important accomplishment in Los Angeles’ water history.

The Mulholland Dam, named after Chief Engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply William Mulholland, is a significant milestone in Los Angeles’ progression of its water systems and as a city itself. Located in the Hollywood Hills, the dam is the first successful concrete dam that Mulholland constructed and it stands as a prime example of its kind. The dam is a 200-foot high, 1,000-foot wide dam in Weid Canyon that yields a broad footpath and is a popular destination for joggers and bikers in the community. The construction of the dam itself holds financial significance as Mulholland was strategically able to build the structure with a budget of $6/yard for the dam, which is impressive since comparable structures in other cities ran for $12/yard. The dam additionally garnered attention as it became a figure in popular culture, being featured in many films and media in Los Angeles including the 1974 film Earthquake, the 1983 film Valley Girl, and the 1930 photograph Man on Steps, Bowl (The Thinker).

Though the dam has garnered popularity due to its structural, financial, and media feats, it was solely constructed to expand Los Angeles’ reservoir system. During this time period, Los Angeles was growing prosperously due to its growing film industry and abundance of job openings. As such, Mulholland strove to expand Los Angeles’ waterways to support the city’s growing population and need for more water resources. For over a year in construction, experts and officials meticulously worked on the dam to ensure its success. Construction of the dam ended in December 1924, with its dedication ceremony only taking place three months later. At the ceremony – which was held on St. Patrick’s Day, as Mulholland is Irish – dozens of people walked along the concrete to the dam's bend where Mulholland stood above the crowd, giving his dedication speech, marking the establishment of a structure that would make history in Los Angeles.

The Mulholland Dam is especially significant to Los Angeles’ water history as it shows the progression the city was able to expeditiously make in such a short period of time. From its development as a small pueblo run by natives and the Spanish, the city was able to develop into an urban metropolis due to the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which Mulholland was responsible for designing and constructing. As the city’s water systems expanded, the Owens River Aqueduct was created in conjunction with the existing aqueduct, and additional waterways and basins continued to be created. Los Angeles kept building its structures and eventually, the Mulholland Reservoir was constructed, allowing the city to store up to 2.5 billion gallons of water from the Owens River Aqueduct and groundwater from the San Fernando Valley – a feat never before achieved. As such, the Mulholland Dam marks a significant point in Los Angeles’ water history timeline and shows how the city was able to exponentially and innovatively move forward. 

Though this historical document may simply seem like an invitation to a dam ceremony, it holds a big chunk of history and meaning within it. It not only tells the context of the dedication ceremony for the Mulholland Dam but also shows the significance in Los Angeles’ progression as a water system and city.
