LA's water history has been one of the water wars. Upstream, the Owens Valley water wars in the early 20th century saw multiple battles between the city and the Owens Valley, culminating in the draining of Owens Lake and the Los Angeles Aqueduct. This paper provides three possible items that might be useful for the write-up portion of the primary source project. In recent years, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has put in place measures to increase the efficiency of its water use.

History.com Editors argue that the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct was crucial in the city's transformation into a major American metropolis in the early 20th century ("Los Angeles Aqueduct"). The aqueduct brought water from the Owens Valley, situated on the eastern part of the Sierra Nevada, to the city of Los Angeles, which needed a better water supply. The aqueduct was completed in 1913, and was the world's longest aqueduct at the time, with a length of 233 miles (375 kilometers). Many people, including President Theodore Roosevelt, admired the aqueduct’s design that let the water circulate through the system by only gravity. Nowadays, the Los Angeles Aqueduct is still in use and supplies water to over 18 million people in the southern California region. This article is significant to LA’s water history as it is one of the few sources that cover the building of the aqueduct in-depth, as well as the conflict that ensued because of it.
Sahagun argues that many years ago, Los Angeles' agents met in Owens Valley on a top-confidential mission. The agents were to buy up land, posing as farmers and ranchers, to get water rights for the city. People from Eastern Sierra quickly found out about the scheme and were not happy. There was already a lot of tension between the two groups because Los Angeles had been taking the valley's water via an aqueduct to foster the city's growth. This created problems for the farmers and ranchers who were trying to make a living in Owens Valley. The Inyo County Board of Supervisors planned to investigate the utilization of renowned domain after the DWP proposed a rent increase for a landfill that the county operates on land leased from the DWP. The significance of this article to LA's water history is that it shows how the county is taking action to get back some of the land and water rights that Los Angeles owns.

Cauhape in her letter to the editor argues that William Mulholland was not a visionary but rather he turned Owens Valley into a dust bowl. Owen valley used to be an agricultural paradise but after Mulholland built an aqueduct to bring water to Los Angeles, the valley turned into a dust bowl. The author believes that a true visionary would build desalination plants along the California coastline to provide Los Angeles with the freshwater it needs without having to steal it from others. Development of urban metropolises often comes at the cost of displacing and exploiting rural areas and their resources and this is what Cauhape is critical of. The significance of this article in LA's water history is that it challenges the dominant narrative that Mulholland was a visionary.
