The image above shows a pamphlet from 1926 that provided information about the Metropolitan Water District Act that would allow cities in Southern California to access water from the Colorado River through a proposed aqueduct. The main purpose of the pamphlet was to attract support for the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct, a 242-mile waterway from the border of Arizona and California to Lake Matthews in Riverside (WTTW). At the time, Southern California was rapidly outgrowing its water supply and the LA Aqueduct was not keeping up with demand. As highlighted in the top caption of the image, this pamphlet was handed out to people with various levels of influence in Southern California. It was given to everyone from members of the California State Legislature to ordinary citizens. The pamphlet specifically targeted smaller cities around Los Angeles who were in need for an alternative source of water, but the overall goal was to reach out to as many people as possible and win over their support.

One subtle, yet key, detail in the pamphlet is the description of the Colorado River’s flow as “waste waters.” This would portray appropriation of the flow as a win-win; less water would be wasted and Southern California could benefit from using part of it. Although discrete, such wording could be enough to gain the support of many voters. Even if a person didn’t believe that the Colorado Aqueduct was necessary, they would reasonably prefer to put the water to good use instead of letting it go to waste.

Compared to other forms of persuasion, this pamphlet is relatively neutral in its advocacy for the project. During the campaign for the Colorado Aqueduct, the Metropolitan Water District took on a much more aggressive approach to gather support. In a film called “Thirst” made by the Metropolitan Water District, Southern California’s water needs were dramatically exaggerated. The film’s opening scene featured two travelers traversing through a desert in search of water. When one of the travelers gives up after not being able to find any, it made the problem seem like a matter of life or death. While the pamphlet presented the aqueduct plan as a feasible solution to Southern California’s water needs, it did not engage in any fearmongering to attract attention.

Five years after the pamphlet was published, the Colorado River Aqueduct was finally approved in 1931. A $220 million bond issue funded the massive project that involved several siphons, canals, and pumping stations that would carry water through mountainous and desert terrains. (Water and Power Associates). Apart from establishing a waterway that would bring in a billion gallons of water each day to several parts of Southern California, the project created roughly 35,000 jobs during the Great Depression. It’s completion marked a remarkable feat that has made the Colorado River Aqueduct one the seven modern engineering wonders according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (Water Education Foundation). More importantly, the new aqueduct ushered in a new era of growth in Southern California that continues to this day.
