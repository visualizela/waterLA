This image was taken in 1942 on the Colorado River Aqueduct, right after it was completed with the hope to ease water limitations in the southern California area, a goal it was able to help complete.

In 1928, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) was founded with the goal to solve the regional water problems facing the Southern California region. The first major project the MWD completed was the Colorado River Aqueduct, which supplied the area with much more water. The project was completed in 1941 and was thought to bring “an everlasting supply of water to the region.

The Colorado River Aqueduct provided a contrast to the Los Angeles Aqueduct as far as engineering went. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, bringing water from California’s Owens Valley to Los Angeles just after the turn of the century, relied solely on gravity and clever engineering to transport such large amounts of water over a long distance. However, such methods proved unattainable in the construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct, as water had to travel a longer distance and could not travel completely downhill the entire length of the aqueduct. The attached map shows the path and the change in elevation at points along it.  As a result, pumps like the ones shown in the photograph had to be used in order to bring the water all the way from the Colorado River Basin to Southern California.

Pumps, such as those pictured, were responsible for carrying massive amounts of water up hills and similar increases in elevation. The following image shows how big the systems were and had to be in order to carry the water, as adults look small compared to the size of the pipe they are standing in. Without these pumps, it is quite possible that Southern California would not have been able to gain the water, which could have fundamentally changed the fate of the area.

The increased amount of water brought to Southern California via the Colorado River Aqueduct (with immense help from the pictured pumps) allowed the region to expand and grow with nearly unmatched speed. Increased water brought the military to Southern California during and after World War II, leading to a boom in both the economy and the population. Orange County went from an agricultural epicenter to one of the most populous counties in the United States, all because of water brought via pumps from the Colorado River. Places like Disneyland were able to open and more and more people began moving to the region hoping to find prosperity and a high quality of life. As the population grew and took up more and more land, transportation increased, generally through the construction of highways and roads, leading California to gain a reputation for having a car culture unparalleled to anywhere else in the U.S.

All of these developments made in the Southern California region were made possible by the Colorado River Aqueduct. The region would fundamentally not be the same without it. And, the Colorado River Aqueduct was made possible by pumping systems, such as the one featured here.
