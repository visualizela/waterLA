Pictured is a screenshot of a page from E.F. Scattergood's article "Electric Power in the Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct." The screenshot text describes how electric locomotives were used during the aqueduct construction, while the image in the middle of the page shows workers operating an electric shovel to efficiently clear space for the aqueduct. Full article published to Proceedings of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1910).

Pictured is an excerpt from an article written in the Proceedings of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on the power used to fuel the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The article was written by E.F. Scattergood, and is called “Electric Power in the Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. This article was published in the year 1910, meaning the article was contemporaneous with the construction of the aqueduct. The Los Angeles Aqueduct is famous for providing the people of Los Angeles with the water it needed to flourish, however powering the construction of the aqueduct was no easy feat. According to the article, the aqueduct is around 240 miles long, so power had to be transported throughout different locations at the same time. It was more cost effective to power the entire project with one central power plant than erecting smaller generators across the length of the plan, so the solution was to transfer power generated through two plants (on Division and Cottonwood creeks) using transmission lines. The power generated in these plants went on to power suction dredges in Owens Valley, electric shoves which greatly sped up the construction of the aqueduct, concrete mixers, locomotives used for excavation, and other miscellaneous appliances. One problem during the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct was the fact that part of the aqueduct passed through an oil district, and would sporadically generate harmful gas. Aqueduct engineers were able to subvert this issue by installing electric sparking machines to act as a sort of “canary in a coal mine,” responding to low gas levels in the atmosphere and alerting workers while simultaneously exploding the gas and thus making it disappear. Another important use for the electricity supplied by the Division and Cottonwood plants was to power telephone lines across the length of the aqueduct, which greatly improved communication for the project as a whole.

The Los Angeles Aqueduct was designed and overseen by engineer William Mulholland. It was finished three years after this article was published, in November of 1913. The Los Angeles Aqueduct was built in order to provide adequate water to the blossoming city of Los Angeles, and drew water from the Owens River much further north of Los Angeles, on the recommendation of ex-Los Angeles Mayor Frederick Eaton.

As a result of the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the population of Los Angeles drastically increased, going from around 200,000 people in 1900 to around 1,250,000 people in 1913 when the aqueduct opened (US Census Data). So while the Los Angeles Aqueduct was certainly expensive and power-hungry, it was an investment worth making considering it spearheaded Los Angeles’s massive population and land expansion. Census.gov has Los Angeles’ current population at slightly under 4,000,000, which comes as a direct result of the construction and maintenance of the Los Angeles Aqueduct.
