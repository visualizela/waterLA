The 1934 New Year’s Flood was preceded by a series of forest fires that intensified the flow by loosening the soil and reducing its ability to absorb water. After around a day of heavy rain, the soil/mud eroded and violently tumbled down the steep mountain slopes, gathering rocks and trees until hitting the Montrose population below. As depicted in the photo, the impact of the debris flows and mudslides was huge. Roads overflowed with mud and rocks, and the force of the debris dislodged trees and damaged houses. It was reported that over 600,000 cubic yards of debris fell in just 13 minutes and rocks weighing tons ended up miles away (Gumprecht 203).

The 1934 New Year’s Flood was part of a much larger issue. LA’s history has been marked consistently by destructive floods, from the mid-1850s to the late 1900s. LA Water authorities have struggled to find adequate solutions to prevent floods and reduce potential damages. This began to be a huge problem, especially with the explosive growth of LA was on the horizon. At the beginning of the 1900s, LA’s population doubled in size every decade (50,395 to 102,479 to 319,198 from 1890-1920), thus forming a dense urban area and creating even more risk (Redner). The steady transition from agricultural to industrial led to more development of urban infrastructure (roads, buildings etc). This increased flood risk as creating more impervious surfaces increases water runoff and reduces water absorption (Konrad).

Even with these growing concerns, LA citizens were still generally hesitant to pass bond issues regarding flood control. In fact, a bond issue in 1926 that proposed the construction of debris basins and flood channels that could have prevented/minimized the disaster was defeated. One reason comes from the time period, as citizens were still struggling to maintain themselves financially from the repercussions of the Great Depression. Coupled with the failures of previous flood control attempts and the sentiment of potentially “wasting” money, LA citizens gained a tentative attitude towards flood control.

However, the damage this 1934 flood inflicted undeniably brought federal attention to LA’s problem and led to large improvements in their flood control plans. After the flood, LA County water officials reworked flood control plans based on the damage, adding specific structures like concrete channels and debris basins above La-Crescenta-Montrose. Despite the damage done to La Crescenta-Montrose, a proposed bond issue with these new additions still was narrowly rejected (Gumprecht 203). With no funding, LA turned to the federal government for assistance which came in the form of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In addition to providing further funding, they played a large role in both flood control construction and remodeling LA’s flood control plans. For example, the plans of the WPA and Army Corp of Engineers pushed for concrete channels as a safer form of flood control with an example being the Arroyo Seco Project (SurveyLA 23-24). These implementations ended up reducing large amounts of damages in floods that came a few years later.
Despite the 1934 New Year’s Flood being one of the most unexpected and violent floods occurring in LA’s history, it also became a monumental turning point for changing their attitude and approach towards flood control which has greatly benefited them even today.
