The article highlights a trip to the St. Francis Dam by USC Viterbi students following the disaster. Students went to tour the site in order to learn more about the dam’s history and its faults—as future engineers, it was essential for them to gain these firsthand experiences in order to prevent such diasters from happening again..

Today, the city of Los Angeles is known as a bustling metropolis that is famous for its cultural diversity, economic prosperity, and myriad opportunities for a better future. However, many don’t know the true story of how modern Los Angeles came to be—since its quaint beginnings as a pueblo under Spanish rule, Los Angeles’ growth can be attributed to water. At any point in the city’s timeline, there have been major strides to provide water to its exponentially growing population. Nonetheless, in order to understand this history, there is a key player one must know—William Mulholland. Mulholland was an Irish civil engineer who was the head of Los Angeles’ Department of Water and Power during the early 20th century, a revered position at the time. He was known for his ambitious projects that seemed impossible at the time, but Mulholland fought to make them a reality. Yet, despite his track record of successful projects and the city’s advances in water technology, the journey towards sustainability was long from perfect, as foreshadowed by fig. 1 under the title, “St. Francis Trip Planned'' (Schulman). The result of this project marks one of the worst engineering disasters in the nation, as well as changing the trajectory of LA’s quest for water forever.

The LA Aqueduct was one of Mulholland’s greatest achievements. Not only did it provide the city of LA water for decades to come, it broke countless engineering feats. Mulholland was able to make the impossible a reality through this project.

Mulholland’s most famous project is arguably the LA Aqueduct, as seen in fig. 2, a “233-mile-long system” that provided “more than ten times the average summer flow of the Los Angeles River” (Standiford). Although the ethics behind the project were questionable, such as the sneaky business deals done behind the scenes and the drying of the once lively Owens Lake, the construction of the project made Mulholland a national hero. Still, this reputation would change a little over a decade later after the construction of a project that should’ve never been built—the St. Francis Dam. 

My primary source (fig. 1) highlights the aftermath of the St. Francis Dam Disaster, coming from USC’s official newspaper article, the Daily Trojan, published in Los Angeles, California in 1929. The St. Francis Dam was one of nine impoundment structures that were built to store a full year’s water supply for the city of LA. While nine structures may seem like an excessive amount of storage, it demonstrates the city’s irrational fear and desperation for water resources. Unlike the other projects, the St. Francis Dam was a project that had many complications before construction, specifically with the geology of the surrounding area. Firstly, there was a lack of clayey material in the surrounding soils that made hydraulic sluicing possible, a technique that Mulholland perfected. Furthermore, uplift and the relative porosity of the surrounding concrete and runoff negatively affected the dam, the latter causing cracks. The problems continued even during construction, as the height was raised without an increase in the thickness of the base, a dangerous combination for gravity dams.

As a result, on March 12, 1928, the “St. Francis Dam had failed—12 billion gallons of water were released. A wall of rushing water standing 125 feet high [destroyed] everything in its path” (Clarita). Tragically, somewhere between 400 and 600 people died that day, some bodies being carried out into the sea, never to be found again. After countless trials and court cases to break down the events of the St. Francis Dam disaster, the jury didn’t deem anyone guilty, but instead, established measures to ensure such a disaster didn’t happen again, stating that “the construction and operation of a great dam should never be left to the sole judgment of one man, no matter how eminent, without check by independent expert authority” (Deverell & Sitton). 

The St. Francis Dam was left in ruin, as conveyed in fig. 3. Nevertheless, the dam became a historic site for research purposes—in fig. 1, USC Viterbi (formerly just called the School of Engineering) students were going to tour the site to gain insight into the dam’s engineering failures. While the document doesn’t specify the student’s majors, there might have been civil engineers who wanted to gain hands-on experience with the construction of dams. In doing so, the next generation of engineers will know what mistakes to avoid in order to prevent such a catastrophic event from occurring again. Today, the site is used mostly for recreational purposes, such as a “hike to the site at San Francisquito Canyon [where] a planned national memorial” will be set (Mancini). The hundreds of lives that were lost that day serve as a reminder to the city of LA to not excuse dangerous practices. With an ever-growing population, it is unrealistic to forbid the city from pursuing these projects, but holding them accountable is necessary to ensure the safety of everyone in LA.
