The Colorado River -  why is a river from another state such an important element to the growth of Los Angeles?

During the 1930s, the city of Los Angeles has been growing at an exponential rate, especially when it came to their population. With more people arriving in Los Angeles comes an increasing demand for water. However, there was one problem when it came to supplying the demand for the people - and that is the fact that Southern California has experienced a series of droughts. Advocates have been pointing out that the Colorado Aqueduct is needed, because without this aqueduct, it could mean severe droughts throughout the city. Pamphlets and posters such as the ones shown in this article have described the urgency to have a new aqueduct in order to economically support most parts of Southern California. Though Los Angeles relied on certain rivers such as the Owens Valley for reasons such as economic support for the city and for the people, the Colorado River was also seen as a beneficial addition in supplying the city with an abundance of water.

The Colorado River is located in the state of Colorado, which can be discovered about several states east from California. The river itself has been described as “a giant river, flowing nearly fifteen hundred miles through the center of an immense watershed, where it has carved out astonishing canyons and gorges across millennia, and where its history and flow influence millions upon millions of people” (Deverell & Sitton 6). With a river so irresistibly plentiful with water, it was with no doubt that many have advocated to have a Colorado River Aqueduct in Los Angeles.

Former civil engineer William Mulholland spent time “in the 1920s working vigorously on behalf of the Colorado River Project, which he saw as the only long-term solution to the city’s future needs” (Standiford 223). While he was originally against the notion of having an aqueduct from Colorado, he realized that the city of Los Angeles needs this aqueduct as a means to support the growing population. The Aqueduct itself could carry enough water for approximately 7 million people, which obviously shows that the Colorado River is capable of supporting a growing metropolis. The fact that the Aqueduct can support so many individuals at once indicates that there is enough water for everybody in the city at a point where they may use the extra liters of water for their own personal use.

Even though the Great Depression was taking place, the Colorado River has physically altered Southern California, as it was mentioned that “Changes spreading across Southern California in the second half of the twentieth century, whether the obvious urban sprawl or the subtler characteristics of daily life, were primarily the result of Colorado River water” (Carle 113).

To emphasize the economic importance of the Colorado River, nature.org has emphasized that “For each of these western states, the river accounts for at least half of its gross economic product. The total is much higher for some state economies, including 65% in New Mexico and 87% in Nevada.” Thus, the Colorado River Aqueduct has a rich history of supplying water to the people of Southern California, even to this day.

DESCRIPTION: Pictured above is a flyer that was created around the 1930s by the Citizens Water Committee. We see that they are clearly rooting for Los Angeles to have the Colorado River Aqueduct. The Colorado River Aqueduct is depicted as a last resort for the city to use otherwise it could end up being in a drought. (Courtesy of Los Angeles Valley College Historical Museum)
