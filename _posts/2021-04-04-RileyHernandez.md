The Daily Trojan is the Student Newspaper at the University of Southern California. The newspaper gives students information, education, and entertainment, and it has been doing so since 1912. This particular article in the Daily Trojan was from the edition that came out on August 14, 1931. This article, titled “Aqueduct is Insurance Policy,” discusses the Colorado River Aqueduct and its benefits.

The Colorado River Aqueduct was a project originally conceived by a man named William Mulholland who was an important engineer who helped build the Los Angeles Aqueduct roughly 20 years before. Mulholland and others realized that the LA Aqueduct and local water supplies alone could not supply enough water to the growing city of LA and the Southern California region, so they planned to build the Colorado River Aqueduct, a 242-mile-long aqueduct to divert water from the Colorado river and bring it to Los Angeles. This aqueduct would be operated by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which was created only a few years before the construction of the aqueduct.

The students at USC at the time had positive things to say about the Colorado River Aqueduct based on the article in the Daily Trojan. The article cites Thaddeus Merriman, a member of the MWD’s board of review, and he claims that the aqueduct is an “insurance policy” for Los Angeles. Merriman and the author of this article seem to believe that, by bringing in water from the Colorado River by the construction of an aqueduct, Los Angeles would be ensuring that it could survive even if local water supplies ran out. Of course, like any form of insurance, the aqueduct would not be free, but the article supports the idea that the costs would be well worth it. Even though the aqueduct would require a $220,000,000 bond issue at the time, the article claims that this number is not large for the district. To someone unfamiliar with prices for construction of water infrastructure, this number may seem like a lot, but LA has proven over the course of its history that no price is too high for water. Los Angeles is a semi-arid climate that does not receive a ton of consistent rainfall each year, so bringing in water from other places has been crucial to the growth of the city throughout its history.
