Joseph B. Lippincott was one of the key figures who contributed to the development of the LA Aqueduct. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Reclamation Service was planning to build an irrigation system for the Owens Valley residents. However, Superintendent of LA Water Department William Mulholland, Former LA Mayor Fred Eaton, and Lippincott collaborated together to ensure that the water supply would be used for the LA aqueduct.

Lippincott worked as a private consultant for LA and as an engineer for the federal government simultaneously. Though he was part of the Reclamation Service, Lippincott’s real interests were for LA to secure the water and land rights necessary for the aqueduct project. In March 1905, he accepted a payment of $2,500 for completing an assignment for the LA Board of Water Commissions, which was more than half of his salary from the government. The money that LA granted him affected his decision to help Mulholland and Eaton’s vision for LA. Lippincott’s conflict of interest came into light when the Reclamation Service fully withdrew from the irrigation project to make way for LA.

When an emergency at the Colorado River occurred in early 1905, Lippincott and his crew of engineers had to leave Owens Valley. Since he needed an engineer to check on power applications in the Owens Valley, Lippincott conveniently hired Fred Eaton to work on this task. While Eaton did help the irrigation project, he also collected information about water rights and ownership, which enabled him to buy the lands he needed for the LA aqueduct. Additionally, Lippincott wrote to a letter of introduction to Eaton that allowed him to pose as an agent of the Reclamation Services. His letter was also used as a guide to point out which lands Eaton would be purchasing for the city.

On June 1st, 1905, Lippincott wrote a letter to Mulholland informing him that the Reclamation Service has decided to abandon the Owens Valley irrigation plan as a government project. This letter was delivered from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. In the letter, Lippincott advises him to acquire documents that encapsulate LA’s superior and urgent water needs. Firstly, he recommends him to gather letters of endorsement from Senator Flint and Congressman McLachlan. Secondly, Lippincott emphasizes that the documents should state that the aqueduct in no way conflicts with the existing irrigation system in the Owens Valley. Lastly, Lippincott asks to request a letter of approval from Congressman Smith of Bakersfield, the representative for Owens Valley. He is essentially giving Mulholland a step-by-step guide to make sure that the Owens Valley water will be delivered to LA. 
This letter reveals that Lippincott colluded with Mulholland by giving him access to insider knowledge. Lippincott was the main force that encouraged the Reclamation Service to step aside and paved the way for the Owens Valley Project. In the end, the Owens Valley river was used to sustain the growing population of Los Angeles instead of an irrigation system for the residents and farmers in the region.
