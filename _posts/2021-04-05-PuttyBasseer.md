In 1902, the city of Los Angeles shifted the control of water from private to public control. Los Angeles bought out the Los Angeles City Water Company and all of its facilities for $2 million. At the time, the zanjas were still used to transport water, but there were often failures with the system and saw great deals of water wasted. As the city of Los Angeles was rapidly growing, those in charge of the cities water, like the superintendent of the Los Angeles Water Department William Mulholland, knew that this outdated system was not adequate if the population continued to increase. Another factor that was very relevant at this time was the lack of rainfall in the Los Angeles area. Southern California had been experiencing a drought during the past few years, so securing a steady water flow was of utmost importance for the Water Department. The first step for a new water supply for the city took place in 1904, when William Mulholland and Fred Eaton voyaged to the Owens Valley. They eventually concluded that the location was optimal for diverting water to Los Angeles, and thus sparked the beginning of what would become the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Due to Eaton’s insider knowledge of eventual aqueduct, he ended up purchasing large plots of lands in the Owen’s Valley, which he purchased for cheap and sold back to the city for a far greater amount once news broke that the aqueduct would be built. Mulholland carefully planned out the project, and after convincing the city that he had their best interest in mind to bring steady water flow to the city, a $1.5 million bond was passed. Two years later, a second bond was passed, this time from the federal government. President Theodore agreed that diverting water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles was for the greater interest of the large population that lived in the LA area. Mulholland’s budget was $24.5 million for the project, and the construction began shortly in 1908. The aqueduct would use gravity to transport the water 226 miles, since the terrain was primarily downhill the entire way to Los Angeles. For the construction workers on this project, they were faced with brutal conditions and little to no safety measures. Temperatures fluctuated between freezing and extremely hot, workers did not wear hard hats, and as a result 43 deaths occurred by the time the project came to its’ conclusion. Approximately six years after construction began, water from the Owens Valley reached Los Angeles. Mulholland had successfully completed the aqueduct at an astonishing $100 thousand under budget. A large celebration was held in Los Angeles where water first flowed, and over 30,000 citizens attended the ceremony. Mulholland was hailed a hero for his efforts, as the amount of water that LA now had access to had increased dramatically. With an abundance of water now in the city, LA experienced significant population growth in the following years and decades. By 1930, the city had four times as many people as it did when the aqueduct was completed, which can be credited to Mulholland’s successful diverging of the Owens Valley’s water to Los Angeles.
