Taken circa 1900, this unique photograph from Elysian Park captures the farming lands and Los Angeles River in present-day Cypress Park and Glassell Park. The abundance of fields at the time is astonishing when compared to the residential and commercial development in the present-day area. In the background, the image captures a few hills and the towering San Gabriel mountains. This image represents Los Angeles approximately 120 years after the Spanish found the city. When the Spanish first encountered the present-day LA Basin, they witnessed a flowing river with a variety of water-loving plants on its banks, dense shrubbery, and abundant trees, laying in lush marshes. While doing further exploration, they met the many Native American tribes that lived along the river. After choosing a location on an elevated parcel of land west of the present-day Los Angeles River, the Spanish began clearing the area of the dense vegetation to make room for their agricultural needs. To bring water from the LA River to their area, they developed their own water distribution system. With the help of the Native Americans, they originally built and maintained ditches and dams to direct water to the pueblo. After hundreds of years of clearing and new influxes of European immigrants, much of the once vegetation and marsh-filled LA Basin became barren land used for agriculture by the European settlers by the 1850s. The land became structured into separate parcels for each individual or family. Some popular agricultural products included grapes to make wine, oranges, and several other exotic fruits and nuts.

Over time, these ditches developed into the zanja system which were elaborate, connected ditches that diverted water from the river to the agricultural lands and residences. Using this insight, the fields captured in the image were most likely pastures, wine grapes, vegetables, and corn fields. Additionally, there were most likely some zanjas from the zanja system that directed water into the fields to irrigate the crops.

However, as LA’s population grew, the zanja system became a central issue due to the lack of oversight and health hazards involved. This caused violence, competition, and health troubles among citizens. To ease these troubles, some underground distribution pipes were installed to replace the open ditch style. Following devastating damage to the water distribution system due to severe flooding, the city voted in favor of a 30-year lease of the city’s water system to the privately held LA City Water Company. Over these 30 years, the company improved and modernized the system by building reservoirs and dams to store water and utilizing more iron pipes. In fact, one of the larger reservoirs was located in the Elysian Hills (where the first image was taken) and became known as the Buena Vista Reservoir. However, due to the growing LA population thanks to the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1876, citizens were demanding for more water and a better distribution system. After the private company was deemed insubstantial for the size of LA, the new public LA City Water Department took back control of the system. Over time, land use evolved from primarily agricultural use to residential and commercial establishments to accommodate the boom in demand.

Captured circa 1926, this residential area (near Cypress Park, Mt. Washington, and Glassell Park) is very close to the area captured in the first image, but it depicts the area about 20 years later. From 1900 to 1926, LA experienced huge population growth, igniting increased residential developments.
