Los Angeles has a long history of flooding that has been recorded since the arrival of the Spanish. It would be many centuries later when a large-scale federal flood control works was finally approved for the Los Angeles River and its tributaries in the late 1930s. The Federal government realized Los Angeles was a strategic-urban center for World War II due to its location on the west coast. The city was in a period of rapid urbanization and economic growth at the time, and protecting the infrastructure was vital. As soon as federal funding came to Los Angeles, flood protection was started. 

However, flood control works had started too late. In “The Los Angeles River, Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth”, Gumprecht described rain starting on February 27, 1938 and intensifying a few days later. Places like the San Gabriel Mountains had received more than 32 inches of rain, an amount they would receive in an entire year. Runoff down the mountains was intense with the ground already saturated. It was a catastrophe in the making. Los Angeles received 6.3 inches of rain in just 24 hours – the 2nd highest in history. The Los Angeles River’s flood discharge was the greatest on record. The reservoirs behind every dam were overflowing. As a result, the river’s tributaries like Tujunga Wash overflowed heavily.

Tujunga Wash, a tributary to the Los Angeles River, overflows in the northern part of the city. In the process, flood protection is destroyed.

The flooding was catastrophic. The United States Army Corps of Engineers was in charge of building flood control structures throughout Los Angeles. Certain flood protections like sandbags and regular concrete were inadequate at stopping the overflow. Reinforced concrete, with paved banks and bottoms, became the most effective form of flood protection. Only a few areas throughout Los Angeles had completed flood control.  Areas located downstream of the Los Angeles River suffered the most damages as flood construction was least developed there.

On March 2, 1938, cascading floods destroyed the 250-foot concrete Lankershim Bridge over the Los Angeles River. Debris fell from the bridge and other infrastructure continued to flow downwards the river. 5 people drowned after the bridge collapsed. The storm ended on March 3, and 115 lives were lost. 108,000 acres of Los Angeles County were flooded. According to Water and Power Associates, “the Los Angeles River reached a maximum flood stage of about 99,000 cubic feet per second”. This flow rate rivals the Missouri River.

Los Angeles was devastated after the 1938 flood. The public demanded more flood control investments to be put in place. The United States Army Corps of Engineers supervised the flood control process. River channels were widened, and the riverbanks were cemented. Gumpecht stated “278 miles of river and tributaries were retrofitted, and more than 300 bridges were built”. Los Angeles had finally taken the steps to prevent another catastrophic flood. Damages totaled to $78 million($1.42 billion in today’s money).
