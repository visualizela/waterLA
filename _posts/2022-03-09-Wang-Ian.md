Los Angeles, located in Southern California, sits in a dry climate with an unstable water supply. With early settlements from migration and increase in agricultural industries came rapid development and urbanisation, leading to an ever increasing demand for water supply on the already scarce natural supplies in the Los Angeles Basin. Surrounded by tall peaks of San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains, waterflow to central Los Angeles was never stable or consistent; it was seasonal and heavily dependent on rain that fell over the mountains and flowed down into the basin. As a result, there would not be a steady water supply, and often floods of great scale would hit during the winter months. An aqueduct project from the Owens valley, led by engineer William Mulholland, was a crucial part in meeting the water demands - fueling Los Angelesâ€™ development - by providing a steady and reliable supply of the most vital life resource.

The letter pictured above is one William Mulholland had written to Fred Eaton (ex-mayor of Los Angeles county) regarding the shortage of water in the city. At this time, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) held control of water supply allocations in the county. William Mulholland was working for the LADWP, and as the letter mentions, was considering cutting the city water supply to the San Fernando Valley due to the scarcity of water. The shortage of water was even mentioned in the Times, thus the severity of water shortage was very apparent at the time. The main water supply was from the Los Angeles river, which would typically run dry during the summer months, since rainfall in the Los Angeles basin were typically during the winter season.

This photograph above is from a 1912 postcard, depicting the dry riverbed of the Los Angeles river. As a result of not having a steady water supply, Mulholland and Eaton worked together to establish the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The two worked together to scout the potential route for the Aqueduct, running 233 miles from the Owens Valley, investing significant planning, finally having the project approved with a bond issue of $23 million for its construction (Water and Power Associates).
