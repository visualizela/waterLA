Several Owens Valley residents at the Alabama Gates on November 16th, 1924. There are a variety of different people, ranging from children to older people. We can also see that there is a band at the gathering, which implies that they were the entertainment of the event. The text on the wall reads: “Band--Its Army of Occupation L. A. Aqueduct Nov. 10 (sic), 20 1924.”

On November 16th, 1924, the people of Owens Valley would fight for water that was once theirs. Known as the Alabama Gates incident, the people of Owens Valley had a 5-day standoff at the Alabama Gates (part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct) to rebel against what Los Angeles had done: use water rights to take Owens Valley’s water for their own use. 
	The people of Owens Valley suffered greatly because of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The aqueduct was built for one reason: to meet the water demands of the growing LA population. The aqueduct was created by William Mulholland, who served as the superintendent of the Los Angeles Department of Water. Mulholland’s creation caused a significant change in Owens Valley. Areas in the Valley lost significant populations, including Bishop who lost 20% of its population. Schools were shut down and various residents lost their jobs. Mulholland had left Owens Valley with a sliver of land and a multitude of problems to deal with, all because LA demanded more water; however, many didn’t see this as an issue. As President Theodore Roosevelt said at the time, this was “the greater good for the greatest amount of people.” The people of Owens Valley heavily disagreed, labeling Mulholland as the “King of Home Destroyers”. These people wouldn’t allow the aqueduct to destroy their homes; instead, they took a fighting stance.

The people of Owens Valley first proposed the idea of having LA pay the Valley $8 million dollars for the remainder of their land, plus $150,000 to make up for the lost income of Owens Valley businessmen. Mulholland opposed this idea, instead offering a 10% increase in water supply for irrigation purposes in Owens Valley. It was clear that no settlement would take place anytime soon. 
Knowing this, on November 16th, 1927, Wilfred Watterson and Mark Watterson- local Owens Valley bankers- led a group of 60 Owens Valley Residents to the Alabama Gates to rebel against what LA had done. The group told the guards at the Alabama Gates that they were relieved of their services, which meant that they now had access to the gates that held the water that was once theirs. The group grew to about 100 people before they released the seized water back on the dry beds of the Owens River. Sheriff Collins was put on the scene to stop what this group had been doing, but the Owens Valley residents continued leaking LA’s water, leaking about 5 million+ gallons per hour, which cost LA about $10,000 a day. Soon enough, the group had swelled to over 350 residents, which included women and children. The event turned into a celebration-type rebel, as barbecues began to take place. Food was being distributed throughout and entertainment took place. The first photo depicts the scene perfectly: residents of all ages coming together with entertainment to stand strong against LA. The atmosphere at the Alabama Gates grew intense, but luckily no military action was taken place against the Owens Valley resistance.

This crime is what was widely considered as the end of the Owens Valley resistance group.

The Alabama Gates incident concluded on November 21st, 1924. LA banker J.A. Graves arrived at the scene and told the resistance group that they could find a legal agreement if they stopped rebelling. Even though the resistance agreed, they didn’t stop rebelling. Thinking it would intimidate LA to make a deal, the resistance continued to bomb parts of the aqueduct. This only made it even harder to for LA to accept a deal, which extended disagreement time and ended up hurting Owens Valley. On August 2nd, 1927, the Watterson Brothers, who led the resistance group, were convicted with embezzlement. Both men faced jail time, which meant that the resistance no longer had their leaders. With no leaders, plus the fact that the disagreements between Owens Valley and LA had been continuing for several years now, Owens Valley finally admitted defeat. Once again, LA had come out on top.
