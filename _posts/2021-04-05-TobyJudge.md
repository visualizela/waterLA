Throughout its history, water has been the cornerstone of Los Angeles’s issues in part due to the cyclical nature of the climate in Southern California. Years of frequent precipitation followed by years of drought forced LA to build extensive water infrastructure to maintain its steadily growing population. One of these infrastructure projects was the Colorado River Aqueduct,  a 242-mile long conduit built between 1933-1941 connecting Los Angeles/Southern California with the Colorado River.

The need for the Colorado River Aqueduct arose when in the early 1920s, the city's population swelled past the point where it could be supplied by the previously constructed LA Aqueduct, which pulled water from the Owens River. Additionally, the over-pumping of wells tapping the groundwater beneath the city led to more and more of them going dry. With expectations that the population would pass 2 million by 1950, finding an alternative water source was a top priority for LA. The initial idea to draw water from the Colorado River came from William Mulholland, chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and builder of the previously mentioned LA Aqueduct. In 1925, after several years of surveying the area, a $2m bond was passed, allowing the Department of Water and Power (DWP) to begin engineering on the aqueduct. The next major step came in 1928 with the formation of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), a coalition of 13 Southern California cities looking to gain access to more water for future development. After the MWD took over responsibility from the DWP for the massive project, it began an obstinate campaign to get the voters to fund it. Part of the campaign was the production of the 1931 short-film Thirst, warning the people of LA that the Colorado River was the only way to keep the city from a severe water shortage. Later that year, a $220m bond issue passed, kicking off the nearly decade-long project. Led by Chief Engineer Frank E. Weymouth of the MWD, the Colorado River Aqueduct's construction began in 1933 and finished in 1941. It was the largest public works project in Southern California during the Great Depression, employing over 30,000 people over the course of the construction.

The Colorado River Aqueduct was, and still is, an engineering marvel, requiring water to travel from Lake Havasu across the Mojave and Colorado, pumped up and over several mountain ranges, crossing under the San Jacinto Mountains all on its way to get to Lake Mathews. In total, the system contains two reservoirs, five pumping stations, 92 miles of tunnels, 62 miles of open canals, 84 miles of buried conduits, even gaining an incredible 1,614ft in elevation as it goes up and over the Whipple Mountains, the Iron Mountains, and the Eagle Mountains. The 13 miles San Jacinto tunnel alone took 6 years to dig. The aqueduct was such a significant engineering achievement that in 1955 it was deemed one of Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

The impact of the aqueduct has been large and lasting. By 1970 the combined populations of LA, Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties had tripled from 3.3million to over 10 million. Even as close as 2015, the MWD provides 60% of the water used by the 19 million people living in its covered area. Unfortunately, the Colorado River's damming has had a very negative effect on the environment, with water no longer reaching the natural estuary and outlet. By the end of the 20th century, the native fish had made their way to the endangered list. For all we know California’s next great water infrastructure project could be just around the corner.
