"This photo was taken during 1928 right after the collapse of the St. Francis dam near the San Francisquito Canyon
or near present-day Castaic and Santa Clarita."

"In 1928, the city of LA, especially Chief Engineer William Mulholland and Los Angeles Bureau of Waterworks wanted to create
a reservoir for Los Angeles Aqueduct System or Owens River Aqueduct. The idea was to build a dam to create a reservoir in the 
San Francisquito Canyon and the dam was known as the St. Francis Dam. The St. Francis Dam was a curved concrete dam that stood 205 
feet and 700 feet in its curvature. William Mulholland oversaw the entire project and was solely built by Los Angeles Bureau of
Waterworks."

"As the photo shows, the St. Francis Dam was massive and made entirely out of concrete. It took about two years for the dam to
be built and after two years of its construction, the dam unfortunately collapsed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths and seven
million dollars in damages. The St. Francis Dam collapse is the "worst American civil engineering disaster of 
the 20th century" due to the resulting damages."

"Before the St. Francis Dam disaster, William Mulholland was known as the godfather of water for the city of Los Angeles due to his 
history of establishing water for the city from a variety of locations. A couple of locations for example would be water from the Owens 
Valley, Mono Lake, and the Colorado River. But soon after the collapse, many people scrutinized and forsake Mulholland because of this 
failure. Many people disregarded his history of successes and focused on his failure."

"Soon after the St. Francis Dam collapse, Mulholland's reputation completed changed from admiration to being looked down upon and thus
ended his career by stepping down as head of the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Waterworks & Supply. Many investigated and investigated 
the faults of the dam and brought to light some of the reasons why the dam collapsed. The main reason why the dam collapsed is because
the left side foundation rock of the dam was not suited for being a foundation and because of this, it re-activated a landslide on the
left side. This destabilized the right side of the dam, causing the whole dam to collapse."

"Some events that occured during and after the St. Francis Dam failure was the idea of building an aquaduct that would bring Los Angeles
water from the Colorado River. The construction of the construction was approved by voters in 1931. Another event that occured after the 
collapse of the dam was the Great Depression. As everyone knows, it was not a great time for everyone and the collapse of the dam surely 
did not help."

"Overall, the St. Francis Dam failure shifted the way people viewed William Mulholland and resulted in devastating damages such as the 
loss of life and infrastructure"
