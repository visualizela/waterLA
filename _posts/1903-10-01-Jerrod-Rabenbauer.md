Drawn in 1903 and digitized in 1936, this map sets the groundwork for anticipated construction regarding the LA Aqueduct project.

Originally created by the City of Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners in October of 1903, a map of the Los Angeles Aqueduct was reproduced as this digital photograph 33 years later. While the design saw tweaks and changes from its conception to completion in 1913, it would soon become California’s biggest water conveyance system, originally stretching a total of 233 miles from Black Rock Springs to San Fernando Valley. The purpose of the original Los Angeles Aqueduct Project led by engineer William Mulholland was to divert water resources from the Owens River, transferring its contents several hundreds of miles to support the population growth of Los Angeles. Existing since 1781 as the Spanish settlement Pueblo de los Ángeles, the area started seeing an exponential increase in inhabitants towards the end of the 19th century; from 1880 to 1890, Los Angeles’ citizens increased from approximately 11,000 people to over 50,000, marking population growth north of 400% over the period (Los Angeles Almanac, 2021). As this expansion helped combat droughts occurring in LA’s recent history, Los Angeles inhabitants were primarily ecstatic about the addition. Evident of the local support, it is reported that on November 5th of 1913, an estimated 40,000 people congregated in Sylmar, a small city within Los Angeles, for the first arrival of water from the aqueduct (LA Times, 2013).

Controversy, however, plagued the LA Aqueduct’s existence. As a result of the destruction to their ecosystem that they knew to come, it is said that Owens Valley farmers and inhabitants attempted to halt the aqueduct’s construction through several bombings occurring from 1907 to 1913 (KPCC, 2013). Moreover, protests and sabotage attempts ensued long after its completion as water was continuously drawn from those residing in Owens Valley; the most notable of these occurred in May of 1924 when roughly 20 people arrived at the aqueduct’s site armed with firearms. Angry with Los Angeles’ practices, they used dynamite to explode part of the aqueduct that they felt was siphoning their water (ATI, 2014).

Since the conduit pulled water directly from Owen’s Lake, the water source for the agriculturally abundant Owen’s Valley, the entire area was soon decimated from the lack of resources needed for irrigation and rich soil; by 1926, only 13 years after the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the once brimful Owen’s Lake was considered to be dry (Reheis M.C., 1991-1994). Despite the negative impact on the source’s environment, Los Angeles’ population growth became increasingly exponential, seeing a population of over 1.2 million residents by 1930, resulting in tenfold growth since the aqueduct was put in use (Los Angeles Almanac, 2021). With this increasing demand for water, Mulholland along with the city of Los Angeles would later develop two extensions to this aqueduct named the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Mono Basin Extension, furthermore increasing Los Angeles’ foothold on California’s water supply.
