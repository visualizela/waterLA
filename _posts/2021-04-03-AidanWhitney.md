In 1928, the Concrete “Iceberg" was taken in the San Francisquito Canyon after the St. Francis Dam collapsed. The enormous piece of concrete shown in the photo only made up a small portion of the giant gravity-arch dam. The St. Francis Dam was an ambitious project headed by the chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, William Mulholland. Mulholland was a self-taught engineer that many consider to be one of the most significant factors in the rapid development of Los Angeles. Mulholland was responsible for many of the major water projects in Los Angeles, such as the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Eleven years after the Los Angeles Aqueduct had been built, Mulholland wanted to create increased water storage for the rapidly growing population of LA in the case of a prolonged drought or natural disaster that damaged the aqueduct. Fortunately, at the time of the proposed construction World War I had recently ended, and America was in a time of sizable economic growth, so multiple advanced, large-capacity dams could be afforded. The St. Francis Dam became the second of nine constructed by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply.

The St. Francis Dam consisted of an upstream face that was nearly vertical, while the downstream side was equipped with a stair-step design. Although it is difficult to fully capture the dam's colossal nature solely in one picture, the dimensions of the dam were a base thickness of 175 feet and a crest thickness of 16 feet. Additionally, the dam towered at the height of 205 feet and spanned 700 feet across in length. The dam was not originally designed to be as tall as it was at the end of its construction. William Mulholland decided to add ten feet to the dam on two separate occasions. The height increase allowed a considerable amount of more water to be stored, but twenty extra feet were not accounted for in base support. A lack of support coupled with the fact that the dam was unknowingly built on rock formations that were landslide-prone led to the dam's catastrophic collapse.

In March of 1928, the operator of the St. Francis Dam contacted Mulholland about what he believed to be an impending blowout due to water overrunning the dam's spillway. Mulholland traveled to the dam on the morning of the 12th and examined the operators' concerns, inspected other parts of the dam, and concluded that the dam was functioning normally. Only 12 or so hours after the inspection, the dam broke. 12.6 million gallons of water funneled down the San Francisquito Canyon, and citizens living in the canyon awoke to the rumbling and shaking of water barreling towards them. Those that the water had not reached yet thought that the earth-shaking amount of water wisping away anything in its path was a large earthquake. Like a significant earthquake, the human-made disaster did immense damage causing $7 million in property damage and took roughly 400 citizens' lives. The Concrete “Iceberg" photo illustrates the reason for many of the deaths and property damage. Most causalities can be attributed to the large objects in the floodwater crushing individuals rather than them drowning. The St. Francis Dam disaster was a catastrophic event that was never forgotten by those that were involved, especially William Mulholland. Mulholland blamed himself for the lives that were lost and took full responsibility for the disaster through his resignation.
