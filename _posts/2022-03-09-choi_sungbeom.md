desc: "What impacts did the LA Aqueduct bring to the Owens Valley?"
---


In the late 1800s, the population in Los Angeles had drastically augmented during the final decade of the 1800s, and massive farmlands began to be swallowed up by residential and commercial developments. Consequently, the demand for water for domestic and industrial purposes rapidly increased. 


As rudimentary as water resources are in human life and all kinds of development, securing sufficient water was the primary issue for Los Angeles. However, extreme demand for water had already reduced the flow of the Los Angeles River to a trickle, and the city was then believed to have the highest per capita rate of water consumption in the nation. In 1901, city residents consumed 306 gallons of water per individual each day, three times the rate of consumption of many eastern cities (Gumprecht). Not to speak of ineffective measures of conserving water, the water shortage was inevitable in the path of the city’s future growth. 


As a final resort, the city began looking for a new source of water that could reinforce the water supply along with the LA River. William Mulholland (a superintendent of the New City Water System) and Fred Eaton (a former mayor of Los Angeles) concluded that the solution to the water shortage could be found in the Owens Valley located in eastern California. These two figures proposed the Los Angeles Aqueduct Project, connecting the Owens Valley and Los Angeles via a 250-mile long aqueduct and importing water from the Owens River. Under the support of the federal government and citizens of Los Angeles, Mulholland successfully passed a bond issue, secured all the necessary rights and properties, and initiated the construction of the LA Aqueduct—it was completed in 1913, and its water first reached citizens’ taps in 1915.


As substantial as specific procedures of the Los Angeles Aqueduct Project and its diverse benefits are as a part of Los Angeles’s history, we must shed light on certain questions. How did the LA Aqueduct affect communities in the Owens Valley? How did Owens Valley residents respond to the project?


Surprisingly, people in the Owens Valley were almost indifferent to the LA Aqueduct Project. They did not pay attention to the news and rumors that Mulholland and Eaton were planning to import water from the Owens River; when Lippincott, the regional engineer for the Reclamation Service, took them around the Owens Valley, none of the residents had aroused suspicions (Reisner). Put differently, the Owens Valley had no particular reason or motive to doubt their project and distrust Lippincott.


However, no sooner had the LA Aqueduct opened than severe losses swept communities in the Owens Valley. Due to the development of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the Federal Lank Bank refused to grant further loans; fire insurance companies had withdrawn from the region; farms were deserted; school districts had lapsed. Especially in Bishop, located in the Eastern Sierra region of California, the region suffered a 20 percent decrease in population, leading six elementary schools to close and another six to be consolidated (Standiford). Even worse, Los Angeles was quite reluctant to reimburse both citizens and businessmen in the Owens Valley who had been damaged by the city’s previous land buyouts and the aqueduct.


Consequently, raging against the city’s attitude towards financial and social damages incurred by its aqueduct, Owens Valley residents started the resistance in several ways. On November 16th, 1924, sixty Owens Valley citizens arrived at the Alabama Gates, and they opened the gates to turn out the aqueduct’s water onto the valley floor. The entire flow of the aqueduct, at least a full 5 million gallons an hour, was being discharged on the desert floor at a cost to the city of approximately $10,000 a day.

The occupying group at the Alabama Gates quickly grew up to 350, including a number of women and their children. The 5-day standoff to the Alabama Gates was resolved when Los Angeles banker Graves proposed the formation of a mediation panel to settle the claims of Owens Valley businessmen and property owners.

Apart from the occupation of the Alabama Gates, some Owens Valley residents did not hesitate to employ violent measures to damage the aqueduct. They made several attempts to burst some parts of the LA Aqueduct with dynamite. For instance, on May 21, 1924, the denotation of 500 pounds of dynamite, installed by enraged ranchers from Bishop, shattered one facet of the conduit transporting water to the distant city (Krist). When investigators arrived at the scene, millions of gallons of water had been already discharged onto the desert floor.

Most of the organized rebellions of Owens Valley residents were resolved with the collapse of the Watterson Brothers’ five valley banks (major banks managing money from many of the residents in the region). When a state bank examiner inspected the books of the Watterson banks, it turned out that there was a huge discrepancy between the cash on hand and what was owed to depositors. All of the deposits had appeared to have been used to support private enterprises owned by the Watterson brothers.


Although the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct has brought significant advantages to the development of the city, we must continue throwing questions to reveal hidden aspects of the project. What damages did it bring to the Owens Valley communities? Were compensations of the city for residents in the region sufficient and effective? What types of misconduct were associated with the process of gaining water rights and properties to build the LA Aqueduct? Indeed, we must perceive not just significant contributions to the growth of Los Angeles but unscrupulous issues behind these accomplishments that were necessary for the path of the city’s expansion. We must evaluate all these facts as the entire history without fabrications.
