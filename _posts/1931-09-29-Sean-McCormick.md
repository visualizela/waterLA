This pamphlet was created by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) in September of 1931 to spread information about the proposed Colorado River Aqueduct system that was to be voted upon at the end of the month. The MWD, which was to oversee this construction project were it approved by the people, hoped that these pamphlets would demonstrate the need for this project as well as highlight some of the benefits that would come along with its construction (Colorado River Aqueduct). As can be seen at the top of every image, the MWD ordered 500,000 copies of this document for general distribution. Along with handing them out themselves, they also gave them to police and fire departments in SoCal for local distribution. This information helps quantify just how big of a project the proposed aqueduct was - the MWD felt it was necessary to produce 500,000 copies and involve local emergency services just to increase its odds of approval. Yet their uncertainty is understandable, as they were asking voters to approve a $220 million bond measure (roughly $3.5 billion in today’s figures) 2 years into the greatest economic crash in American history (75 Years). The crash of the stock market and beginning of the Great Depression had occurred only 23 months prior, so the MWD knew they would have to make this project seem absolutely necessary in order to ask for such a massive sum of money during those times. And although the bond was to be paid off in the future, the project’s approval would still place extra economic strain on the people of SoCal during a time of great economic uncertainty (Carle p. 123). For this reason, the MWD made sure that the pamphlet explained to the voters exactly what their money was being used for, how it would benefit them, and ensured them that it was worth the high price.

The pamphlet contains 6 different subtopics, all of which present important information for the voters to consider. The first, titled “Thirteen Cities”, simply gives a summary of all 13 cities in the district that will fund the project and reap its benefits. The next section,  “All the Way”, emphasizes that the proposed project will bring the water all the way to each city, and it will come with no additional costs upon completion. The next 2 portions, “We Need Colorado River Water” and “Aqueduct Need Stressed”, argue the necessity of this plan - pointing out that their current growth rate is unsustainable given the current water supply - and highlight some recognizable endorsers of the project. The final sections, “Fifteen Years” and “Water Rights”, inform the voters that they will not have to start paying off the bonds for another 15 years, and the US Government has confirmed their rights to the Colorado River water (Sept 29 We Will Vote). Lastly, the pamphlet also includes that the project will bring 10,000 jobs to the 13 cities, which must have been especially appealing during that economic downturn.

It’s impossible to measure the effect this pamphlet had on SoCal voters at that time, but given that the vote passed with an 82% approval rating it’s safe to say that the overall MWD campaign was very successful (Construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct). The actual construction of the aqueduct finished a decade later in 1941 and transported nearly 1 billion gallons of water to SoCal daily!
