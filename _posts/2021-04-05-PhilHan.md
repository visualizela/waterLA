This picture gives us a realistic view of how the hydrographic structures and construction around the Zanja Madre looked like during the time that it was active."

Following the Portolá expedition, a group of settlers founded El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles, what we know today simply as Los Angeles in order to supply the Santa Barbara and San Diego presidios of the Spanish empire. Almost immediately after the founding of the settlement, given that such Spanish settlements were mainly agricultural, the settlers strove to utilize the LA River to provide water for not just domestic but also agricultural use. As such, LA began working on the Zanja Madre and the zanja system, a series of open-air canals throughout the city, which became one of early LA’s most critical infrastructures. 

Only seven weeks after the founding of the pueblo, in late 1781, settlers completed the Zanja Madre. The ditch was created from wood, clay, and stone, and later was reinforced by brick and concrete. Given that the pueblo was geographically located in a desert-like area with temporal rainfall, acquiring a year-round means of irrigation was critical for the survival and success of the agricultural town. The zanja system initially had no pipes or waterwork systems to deliver water to the city’s residents and farms, thus native labor was also heavily used to deliver water to city residents and maintain the zanja ditches.

Decades of development later, by the Mexican Era (1821-1848), the zanja system, specifically the water it provided, had become so vital to the success of LA that the person in charge of the system, the zanjero, became the most powerful official in the city. The zanjero’s duties, on paper, weren't grandiose: it simply included collecting fees, supervising deputy zanjeros, etc.; however, they had a tremendous amount of soft power and were considered the most important civic official in LA. Furthermore, by 1860-61, the zanjero’s salary was more than the mayor’s. Mayor Cristobal Aguilar explains the power of the zanjeros by stating, “the prosperity of the City of Los Angeles depends entirely upon the proper management and distribution of the waters of the Los Angeles River,” thus, he who controlled and regulated the water had power.

As critical as the zanja system was for the survival and success of LA, it also had its flaws. Primarily, people were using the zanjas as a dumping ground. Given that they were open-air, livestock and humans often frequented the area around the zanjas and polluted them. Dysentery, typhoid, and smallpox was also rampant due to the pollution of the drinking water the zanjas carried. These health hazards that the zanja system posed became so apparent that the Common Council passed many ordinances to regulate the quality of the water. 

As the population of Los Angeles rose, more infrastructure was added to the zanja system. The person at the forefront of these improvements was William G. Dryden, clerk of the Common Council. In 1853, Dryden proposed a waterworks system that would deliver water in pipes to residents for domestic use. Another development initiated by Dryden was the Elysian Park waterwheel (as seen in the picture above) which not only facilitated the distribution of water but also became the city's first source of industrial power. Even the legendary William Mulholland’s first job in LA was trending to the zanjas.

However, as the population of LA nearly doubled due to the arrival of the transcontinental railroad in 1874, the zanja system started to become obsolete, for it could no longer support the burgeoning population of Los Angeles. By 1888, the city had closed 4,900 feet of the zanjas, and by 1904, the entire system had been abandoned as LA looked into other sources of water such as groundwater and began searching for water outside the city’s limits. Yet, since its founding and throughout its glory and obsolescence, the zanja system was critical to Los Angeles’s survival and success—it was at the foundations of Los Angeles’s development from pueblo to city to metropolis.
